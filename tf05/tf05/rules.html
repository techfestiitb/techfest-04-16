<h1>Machine Specifications </h1>
<ol>
<li>The machine should fit within a box of dimensions (25x25x25) cm at any and every given point of the game. The external device which is used to control the machine manually is not included in the size constraint.</li>
<li>The machine must use only mechanical power or mechanical power converted from a source of electrical energy. Chemicals, compressed gas and rockets, fuels, combustion power methods are strictly prohibited.</li>
<li>All the machines have to be necessarily controlled by some wireless control mechanism till the line following stage. In these stages, autonomous mechanism can also be used. Wire control is not allowed at any stage of the matches. The machines should be strictly autonomous in the line following stage.</li>
<li>The machine must have onboard source of power. External source of power is not allowed. The total of the rated voltages of the onboard batteries should not exceed 54 volt. This will be checked before the game starts.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<a name="rules"></a>
      <a class="topOfPage" href="#top" title="Go to the top of this page">^ TOP</a>
      <h1 id="introduction">Game Rules</h1>
<ol>	
<li>The match begins from the start of the track on the ridge. The machine has to climb up the track to reach to the top of the platform 1 m high.</li>

<li>The machines are not allowed to enter the red zone or cross it to the 
opposition side on the top of the platform. Jumping off from the platform, 
from the red zone or from the opponents side of the platform during stages 
1b and 1c will attract disqualification. </li>

<li>The machines have to jump off the top of the platform onto the coir flooring below (Stage 1c). </li>

<li>After landing on to the coir flooring (Stage 1c), the machines have to reach the gate, through which they enter Stage 2a of the arena.</li>

<li>The machines must enter stage 2A through the gate at the entrance of the stage.</li>

<li>In Stage 2a of the arena, 6 blocks are placed at a distance of 30 cm from the centre line, 3 on each side. The first pair of blocks is positioned at 40 cm from the gate and the following two pairs at another 50 cm each from the previous pair.</li>

<li>The 7th block is placed on the centre line at a distance of 190 cm from the gate.</li>

<li>The machine either has to place these blocks in their respective zones or in the corresponding place holders. The blocks should be fully inside the specified zones or the placeholders to earn points.</li>

<li>In Stage 2b, the blocks have to be properly positioned in a zone or a placeholder. The whole of the block should lie inside the respective zone or placeholder for the points to be awarded to the team. The decision of the judge is final and binding.</li>

<li>The machine should be directed to the zone of Stage 3a and brought to a stand still at an appropriate position within the zone. Then the remote control mechanism on the machine should be switched off and the control unit should be handed over to the judges for inspection. It will be checked by the judge that the remote control mechanism is not working after it has been switched off.</li>

<li>After the machine comes to a standstill on Stage 3a, one team member can switch on the autonomous switch through the control unit or manually. This the only time during the match that a team member is allowed to touch the machine. The machine can be repositioned or realigned inside Stage 3a by the team member after it has come to a standstill. The handling time is also included in the total match time and no extra time will be allocated in Stage 3a or the whole match.</li>

<li>In Stage 3b, the machine must follow the white line in an autonomous manner. The machine has to displace the tennis ball(s) placed at the check point(s), in the same sequence as of their positions on the white line. For each tennis ball the machine displaces in the correct sequence, corresponding points are awarded. </li>


<li>If a machine clears all 5 check points in Stage 3b, by displacing all the tennis balls in the correct sequence, then the machine must stop in the zone for Stage 3c. Successfully stopping in this zone finishes the game.</li>

<li>The machine cannot come back to a previous stage once it crosses a particular stage. For example a team cannot come back to stage 2B once it reaches stage 3C and so on.</li>

<li>During the whole duration of the match the machine should not get outside the arena. In case the machine gets out of the arena, it will be disqualified.</li>

<li>The time limit for each match is 15 minutes. The match ends when either both machines complete Stage 3c or either of the machines is disqualified or the time limit of 15 minutes is reached. At the end of the match both machines will be judged on the basis of points earned.</li>

<li>The machine should not be made using Lego parts, assemblies from toys etc. However the remote control systems from toys can be used. However, standard kits like the Basic Stamp kits may be used.</li>

<li>The wireless remote control should be so chosen that it does not interfere with the remote control of the other team during a match. If a team uses non coded, common frequency radio control from normal toys which can be controlled by other similar remote control units, the team has to use two different frequency remote controls which can be readily changed from one to another before the match (This is an inexpensive option recommended.). More complex wireless systems (multi-channel RC) can also be used but it has to be ensured that no interference takes place during the match. This is of great importance and should be necessarily ensured.</li>

<li>In case of a tie between two teams in a match, the teams are required to play rematch (es) till, one of the team wins a rematch or one of the teams withdraws from the competition.</li>
</ol><br>

<a name="points">
      <a class="topOfPage" href="#top" title="Go to the top of this page">^ TOP</a>
<h1>Points Structure</h1>
<ol> 
<li>Traveling up the ridge, to reach to the top of the platform - 100 points.</li>

<li>Landing on the coir flooring after jumping off the platform.            
For deciding the number of points obtained on the basis of landing; the distance of the end of the machine, closest to the foot of the platform, in Stage 1c after the first impact with the ground, will be taken into consideration.<br>


The landing zones and the corresponding points are:<br>

Zone A - 50 points<br>
Zone B -  100 points<br>
Zone C -  120 points<br>
Zone D -  140 points <br>
Zone E  -   160 points<br>
Zone F  -    200 points<br>
    </li>
         
<li>Each block in the next stage (Stage 2b) has specific points associated with it. The first pair of blocks on either side has a value of 20 points each. The next pair has a value of 10 points each. And the third pair has a value of 30 points each. The last block on the centerline has a value of 40 points. </li>

<li>Placing a specific block in the place holder successfully - full points associated with that block will be awarded. Placing a specific block in the outermost zones successfully - half of the points associated with that block will be awarded. For example, if a machine places a block worth 20 points in the placeholder successfully, it earns 20 points, and if the machine places the same block in the outermost zone, it earns 10 points. </li>

<li>Successfully halting in Stage 3a and not entering Stage 3b without the autonomous mechanism running - 10 points</li>

<li>In Stage 3b, displacing each tennis ball in the correct sequence - 30 points. The machines must be running in an autonomous manner in Stage 3b and Stage 3c for any points to be awarded for these stages.</li>
       
<li>Successfully reaching the Stage 3c zone after completing Stage 3b and stopping in       this zone to a standstill - 30 points.  </li>
<li>In a single match, points can be earned only once from any single block.</li>
<li>In a single match, a team can earn points of any stage or any part of a stage only once.</li>
<li>Penalty for entering the red zone in Stage 1b - 20 points.</li>

<h1>General Rules</h1>
<br>
<h3>Sensors and Electronics</h3>
<p>The teams can use sensors (if they so desire) to sense any physical parameters. Interference due to flash lights/arena lighting/daylight should be taken into consideration. For the autonomous robot machine, the participants may/may not use sensors and microprocessors. Standard kits like the Basic Stamp kits may be used.</p>

<h3>Power Supply</h3>
<p>The power supply of the machines has to be onboard. No external power 
source is allowed. The total of the rated voltages of all the batteries 
onboard should not exceed 54 volts. The power source of the control pad 
used by the operator is not included in the total voltage limit. 220 +/- 
2% volt 50 Hz AC power supply will be provided at the arena. No special demands shall be entertained. Please do not demand heavy equipment like compressors. </p>

<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>The machines you build will be first checked for size and safety. The machine should not cause electrical power breakdowns. The robots must not contain any combustible, corrosive, or otherwise dangerous materials. No explosive compressive or expansive, either internal or external is permitted. There is a risk of compressed containers rupturing and creating shrapnel. Any robot whose strategy or operation is considered dangerous can be disqualified by the judges at their discretion.</p>

<h3>Breakdowns/Timeouts</h3>
<p>There is no provision for breakdown or timeouts in a single match. Your machine must be sturdy enough to participate in several rounds, leading to the finals. </p>

<h3>Fouls/Penalties:</h3>
<ol>

<li>Team members are not permitted to touch either their machines or those 
of their opponents once the game begins. The penalty for doing so is 
disqualification. The only time a team member is allowed to touch the 
machine is during Stage 3a. No addition or removal of any part(s) is 
allowed in any of the stages.</li>
<li>The robots are not allowed to dismember themselves or leave parts on 
any part of the arena. </li>
<li>Machines damaging any part of the arena will be disqualified.</li>
<li>During the game run if a machine is static continuously for a minute 
than the machine is disqualified.</li> 
</ol>
<br>

<h3>Machine Names</h3>
<p>The name of your machine must be prominently displayed on the machine.</p>

<h3>Sportive and Friendly Games</h3>
<p>Intentional damage to the opponent's machine is not allowed. Goodwill and friendship between competitors may evaporate if, for example, one opponent uses lightening bolts to destroy the electronics of the competitor.</p>

<h3>Scratching a Team</h3> 
<p>Any team that is not ready to play at the time specified will be scratched automatically. This applies to Eliminations, Prelims and Finals rounds. 15 minutes will be allowed for the final adjustments.</p>
 
<h3>Demonstration to Judges</h3>
<p>Machines will have to be demonstrated to judges (who will evaluate the machines for other prizes) at a time and date specified in the schedule which will be put up. Any team that does not turn up at the specified time will not be considered for the above special prizes.</p>

<h3>Demonstration of Machines at Final</h3>

<p>The Finals will be conducted in front of a large audience. Teams which have lost in the Prelims will be required to demonstrate their machines (one minute per machine) to the audience at that time. A group photograph of all the machines/participants will be taken. The date, time and venue will be specified at the time of competition.</p>

<p>The organizers will not provide any system like microprocessor kits, computers etc. at the venue.<br>
The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit. The decision of the judges and the organizers will be final and binding.<br>
The whole game is based on points fetched in a specified time.
