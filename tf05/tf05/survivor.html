<p>Excerpts from a top secret Moon Mission :</p>

<p><b>Astronaut</b> : Sir, I don't think She's going to survive the fall.<br>
<b>Ground Control</b> : You do your job and we'll do ours. That's what She was
designed for and She won't fail.
</p>
<p>
<b>Astronaut</b> : It's my life on the line. And even if She does survive....<br>
<b>Ground Control </b>: There's no if. She was made for this fall. Every component is ready
and designed with the impact in mind.</p>
<p>
<b>Astronaut</b> : But what about later? Will She still be in a healthy enough state to
pick up rocks and move them around once she lands?<br>
<b>Ground Control</b> : Learn to trust the designers Son. She will land. She will survive.
She will play with the rocks. She will survive. She will find her way
there all by herself. And at the end of it all, she will still be alive.
Why do you think she's called "Survivor"?
</p>

ranked on the basis of number of points earned within a time span of 10 
minutes. Every team will be provided with  just one chance to perform on 
the arena. Incase of a tie, the machine completing the task in the least 
time will be ranked higher.</p>

requests will be considered later on. The eliminations are going to be
