<p>Over the years, Techfest has grown in stature, both in terms of its content, as well as its logistics. 
The dream, which had humble beginnings, has come to become a technical bonanza, drawing crowds numbering 
in tens of thousands. When one talks of such magnitudes, hospitality of the guests becomes a primary concern!
 Techfest tries its level best to satisfy one and all.</p>

<p>Right from the moment you land here at Mumbai, we will take care of all your needs during your stay at Techfest 2005.
