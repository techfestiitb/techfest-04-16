      <h1 id="introduction">Drishti</h1>

   <p><img src="./img/drishti.jpg" hspace=5 vspace=5 align="right">Did you know that one out of every 80 Indians is a blind person ? Have you ever given a thought to the fact that despite all the technological advancement we have made we still have a long way to go as far as elegant aids for the blind are concerned ? </p>
  <p>On 14th of October 2004, on the occasion of the World Sight Day, Techfest 
    2005 launched DRISHTI. </p>
    <p> Techfest, in association with the National Association for the Blind (NAB) has undertaken to call upon students to come up with practical,affordable and innovative solutions to aid the visually impaired. Techfest will collaborate with the NAB to ensure that the entries received are provided with the requisite support needed to develop into functional aids.</p>
      <p>We hereby intend to contribute its bit to the society, by encouraging the budding engineers and scientists to apply their brains for this noble cause. The motto is clear - 
making this world a better place to live in.</p>


<p>What is the competition ?</p> 

<p>The participants are expected to come up with workable solutions as aids for the blind. Simply an idea on paper is 
not what we look for. You are encouraged to present a solution which is practical and implementable.<br>
<br> Total cash prize of <b>Rs 20,000</b> to be won!</p>

 <h1>Judging Criteria</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ease of use (easy training  - requiring less man hours for learning to use it)

</li><li>Cost effectiveness (The cost of the solution should not be prohibitive when produced at the small scale. There is no fixed acceptable cost, though. Different solutions would have different acceptable costs. )

</li><li>Technological feasibility (only idea is not what we expect. The solution should be workable, with minimum gliches. Clear technological details are sought for.)
</li>
</ul>


<h1>General Rules </h1>
<ul>
<li>Students currently enrolled for up to an undergraduate/postgraduate program at their institute are eligible for the competition.
</li><li>Number of members per team should not exceed three.

</li><li>Every team has to register online at our website for the competition. A registration number will be allocated to the team on registration which shall be used for future reference.

</li><li>Pre-event abstracts need to be submitted for the competition for the screening round. Kindly read all the instructions given on this page before writing your abstract.
</li><li>The abstract should be mailed to abstract@techfest.org with the subject 'Drishti- Abstract Reg. No. -------' or posted to us at our postal address. Do not forget to mention the registration number.


</li><li>In case the participants fail to submit the abstracts by the last date, their registration shall stand cancelled.

</li><li>Only the participants who qualify after the screening round based on judging of the abstracts shall be invited to Techfest 2005 for the competition.

</li><li>On a single chart paper, the team should explain their solution with figures, diagrams and relevant material. A detailed report in support of the design and highlighting the important aspects should also be brought.

</li><li>The report along with the chart paper will have to be submitted to the competition coordinator at the time of the competition.

</li><li>Participants should submit their hardware, software and other requirements needed at the time of competition along with the abstract for the screening round.

</li><li>Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.
</li><li><b>The last date for registration and submitting abstracts is 5th 
Jan 2005.</b>  

</li>
</ul>

<h1>Some instructions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Abstracts can be submitted either handwritten or typed.
</li><li>First sheet should only contain title of the project, team registration number, names of the team members and their respective institutes.

</li><li>Typed abstract should not exceed three A4 sheets of text with a font size of 12 excluding the first sheet containing the title.

</li><li>Handwritten abstracts should not exceed 1200 words.

</li><li>Diagrams should be on additional sheets (graphic representation of the project is encouraged).

</li><li>The abstract should be concise and to the point.

</li><li>It is recommended that vital aspects of the project that require special focus are mentioned as points.
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Guidelines</h1>
<ul>
<li>The solution use off the shelf components.
</li><li>Devices for individual ( personal ) use should be small, light.
</li><li>Getting actual test data from uninterested third parties describing whether the solution works for them is encouraged.
</li><li>The training cost of using the solution must not be high. People should not take more than about 8 man hours to learn to use the particular solution.
</li><li>Information on using the solution must be easily accessible.
</li><li>End result should make the person independent  and not need sighted help for even small things connected with the gadget or solution.
</li><li>You may improve up on an existing solution 
</li><li>The solution should not pose a new problem.
</li><li>You may youself identify some problems faced by the blind, and work upon the solution for the same. In case you have any doubts about the importance and/or relevance of the problem on which you are working, you may contact us to clarify them.
</li>
</ul>


<p>These are some of the ideas and suggestions by few visually impaired people.  </p>

<p>"Whitecanes, used as guides while walking, are available either as rigid or folding canes. The folding canes are vulnerable to break-downs as an elastic cord runs through them. In the west, however, collapsible canes avoid the
hassle. These are too expensive, sometimes, though. </p>

<p>Reading manuscript  : Speech softwares fail to recognize manuscripts. So, to read handwritten material,human assistance is a must.</p>

<p>Operation of gagets : Day-to-day use gagets like the music system, television, washing machine, kitchen-ware  and the like are sometimes difficult to use, because of the sets of key commands,which might differ from brand to brand. Developing a plan to make the products one of the consumer products, available for sale, in the market place. Making sure its wide-spread availability. "</p>

<p>"One problem relates to turning the pages of a book while scanning. If I am scanning a book using a flat bed scanner, then there is no automatic way to turn the pages of this book. I could use a document feeder but that would involve removing the binding of the book."</p>

<p>" Developing a cricket ball for the blind to play cricket.  Wre already have a ball that is used World wide,  we are looking for an improved ball."</p>

<p>"There devices recently in market such as Victor Trekker, which is connected to satellite and helps the blind follow the road or the exact place, where he is through voice description. Makers of this device have promised to enhance its features such as making it capable of reading signboards and name boards and even menus in restaurant. What thisdevice isn't made to do is giving the blind person the exact length or width of the road he is walking, if someone is coming exactly opposite
to him or any object in front of him. I would like this device to be enhanced to function the way I described it here. I don't know how technically feasible such a device would be, but that's the challenge for scientists to face."
