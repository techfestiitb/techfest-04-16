      <h1 id="introduction">CRO 1.0</h1>
<p><img src="./img/crogrid.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=0 align="right">
Make a grid completion game( as described below) through an electronic 
circuit, the display of which has to be on a standard Cathode Ray Oscilloscope 
(CRO). Apart from the execution of the logic of the game, you will also have to 
work on the basic appearence of the game. The game has to be playable by any user 
through an input device.</p>
<br><br>Total cash prize of <b>Rs 15,000</b> to be
won!<br><br><br><br>

<h1>Eligibility</h1>

<p>Students currently enrolled for up to an undergraduate/postgraduate 
program at their institute are eligible for the competition.</p>

<h1>Team Size</h1>
<p>Number of members per team should not exceed three.</p>

<h1>Game Description</h1>
<ul>
<li>The game consists of a lattice of 9 x 9 = 81 points as shown in the 
figure. There are 9 rows of points, each row having 9 points.

</li><li>This game is a two player game. The two players get alternate turns to play.

</li><li>A player is allowed to draw one horizontal or vertical line joining two consecutive points at a time.

</li><li>The aim is to complete as many sqaures ( of size 1 x 1 ) as possible. The player with more number of sqares awarded to him, wins.

</li><li>A sqaure is awarded to the player if he draws the line thereby completing the square. Thus, any square belongs to the player who completes it by drawing the fourth side.

</li><li>If a player completes a square, then he immediately gets a bonus chance 
to draw one more line.

</li><li>If in any turn, some player gets chance to complete a sqare, he has to 
complete it. Thus, he is not allowed to draw a line at some other place, and leave some 
available square incomplete.

</li><li>In this competition, the participants have to make a one player game, 
that is, one human player will be playing against the device made by the 
participants. The device should make autonomous decisions for making its moves. All the rules of the game mentioned above should be followed.

</li><li>The game should be played and displayed on a CRO by generating appropriate shapes. The human player should be able to make his moves through an input device.

</li><li>In the display on the CRO, the squares should be assigned two different identification marks for the two players. A sqare will have a mark, belonging to the player who completed the square.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Judging Criteria</h1>
<ul>
<li>Algorithm used for the game;
</li><li>The implementation of circuit design;
</li><li>Overall user-friendliness;
</li><li>The display created on the CRO.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>General Rules</h1>
<ul>
<li>The game should be made using any of the 8051 architecture microcontrollers. No other microcontrollers are allowed in the circuit.

</li><li>The display of the game should be on a standard CRO which is commonly available in all electronics laboratories.

</li><li>The teams should try to use the best possible algorithm to run their machine against the human players. But negetive algorithms and methods should not be used. The alogorithm used in the machine should also be explained during the competition. If the algorithm is found to be unfair then the teams will be disqualified.

</li><li>Every team has to register online at our website for the competition. A registration number will be allocated to the team on registration which shall be used for future reference.

</li><li>On a single chart paper, the team should explain their device with figures, diagrams and relevant material. A detailed report in support of the design and highlighting the important aspects should also be brought.

</li><li>The report along with the chart paper will have to be submitted to the competition coordinator at the time of the competition.

</li><li>Standard Cathode Ray Oscilloscope ( CRO ) and 220 +/- 2% volt 50 Hz AC power supply will be provided at the site of the competition.
</li>
<li>Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.</li>
<li><b>The last date for registration is 5th Jan 2005.</b>
</li>
