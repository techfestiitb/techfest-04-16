    <div id="main-copy">
      <h1 id="introduction">U-Turn</h1>
<p>

Ten feet and back. That's all that machines need to traverse to successfully complete U-Turn.</p>

<p>Sounds easy?</p>

<p>Ha! You jump to conclusions quickly, don't you? The car (or machine, put whatever you want) will have to be 
controlled on a self chosen fuel and a corresponding reaction both of which should not only be effecient, but also get 
over just in time! That means the car has to go ten feet, no further and then come back ten feet, no further! To add to 
an already tough problem, no mechanical systems (Brakes and the sort) are not allowed.</p>

<p>At Techfest, things are never what they seem, are they?</p>

<p>The creativity in design, the error in the distance and a poster which the participants make about the car will all 
have a say in the final result. This event is something you don't want to miss!
</p>
<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>There would be two portions to the U Turn Competition; a poster presentation and a car performance. The poster competition will carry a weightage of 20% while the rest 80% is for the car performance. Any team failing to present any one of these will be disqualified.</p>

<h3>Poster </h3>
<ul>
<li>A poster board must be displayed with the autonomous car on the day of the competition. This poster should describe how the car is powered using the chemical reaction, the unique features of the car, and environmental and safety features in the design. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be present for each chemical used by the car. Safety and safe transportation procedures are important items to address. If obvious safety violations have occurred, the judges have the discretion to disqualify the car. Entries will also be judged on creativity in the driving system and the appearance of the car. 
 
</li><li>The poster competition and judging will occur prior to the car performance competition. Team members should be present during judging to answer questions from the judges. 
 
</li><li>Posters will be judged according to the following criteria, with a maximum of 20 possible points (equal weighting): 
<ul>
<li>Description of the chemical reaction / control mechanism
</li><li>Unique features of the car 
</li><li>Design creativity 
</li><li>Environmental and safety features 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Car Performance Competition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each car will be given two opportunities to traverse a distance of 10 feet and return to the original position automatically. Teams are allowed to adjust "fuel" or reactants used in the car's chemical reaction. 

</li><li>The car power supply should be on-board, no external power supply is allowed. Power supply can be anything from a gas propulsion mechanism to a standard AA size battery. 
</li><li>The car will start with its front tyres just touching the designated starting line. There will be a designated finish line. The distances will be measured with respect to the initial front most tyre of the car. The goal of the competition is to have your car stop closest to the starting line after making a forward journey till the buffer zone as shown in figure. The course will be rectangular shaped with a starting line and the prescribed distance clearly marked. The car failing to return will be disqualified. A car that goes outside the course on its return journey will have its distance measured to where it went out of bounds and will receive a penalty of 5ft. added to the measured distance. When measuring the distance from the start line it does not matter if the car goes longer or shorter than the prescribed distance. The error in the forward journey will be measured from the nearest buffer zone boundary and will be then added to the starting line error
 

</li><li>A judge will announce each team just prior to the start of their run. The team then has 5 minute to get to the starting line. Each team will be asked to introduce their car to the audience (College name and briefly mention your control system). Each car will have 2 attempts to complete the course, each attempt lasting no more than 5 minutes. The best score of these two attempts will be used in the judging. The next team to compete should be ready and at the staging area at least 5 minutes before their anticipated time of run. In the event a team fails to show up on the start line, or the car fails to start, the next team on the competition order list will be announced and requested to proceed to the starting line. In the first round of competition the order of the teams will be by random drawing. The competition order in the second round will be determined by the 1st round standings, beginning with the team that is farthest from the prescribed distance and ending with the team that was closest. 
 

</li><li>In case of a tie, winner will be decided on the basis of average of two runs.
 

</li><li>The car must be an autonomous car and cannot be controlled remotely. Pushing to start the car or a mechanical starting device is not allowed. Check with the Rules Coordinator if you have a specific question concerning your car.

</li><li>No mechanical force can be applied to the wheel or ground to slow or stop the car (e.g. no brakes).

</li><li>The autonomous control should be based on Chemical engineering fundamentals. Viz Mass/Heat/Momentum transfer, thermodynamics and reaction engineering.

</li><li>All components of the car must fit into a shoebox of dimensions no larger than 40 cm x 30 cm x 18 cm. The car may be disassembled to meet this requirement. If the judges are uncertain whether the car will fit inside the box when dissembled, they may request that the team demonstrate that they can do this.

</li><li>Students are responsible for transportation of the chemicals to the competition site. They are also responsible for arranging for the disposal of their chemicals and wastes. A barrel of tap water and an empty barrel for waste disposal will be made available on the site.. Hazardous chemical protocols must be followed and reported on the poster. Each team must have a MSDS for each chemical it is using. If obvious safety violations have occurred, the judges have the discretion to disqualify the car.
</li><li> Appropriate personal protection must be worn by those team members operating the car. All cars must safely operate inside a building. If a car is deemed unsafe, then the judges may disqualify it. Given the general public's lack of understanding of general chemistry, anything that is visibly left behind may well be construed as chemical pollution, and even hazardous. Any car using or producing a corrosive chemical(s) must have the chemical(s) sealed in a container, or at least use a spill-proof container.The container must have a lable of the chemical stored in it. If there is any uncertainty on an issue of safety or other judging criteria, please contact:

</li><li>In order to facilitate chemical safety at the competition site, a designated area will be identified where teams must mix or prepare their chemicals (unless the material are pre-mixed). All chemicals will be made available to the teams in the chemical preparation area at least 2 hours prior to the performance competition. Unfortunately, due to hostel safety regulations it is not possible to allow teams to do "trial runs" in the hostels. Teams that violate these safety rules jeopardize the continued operation of U Turn Competition and may be disqualified by the judges.


</li><li>Three categories have been created. The award criteria will be as follows:
Most Consistent Performance  This award is based on the best average score for the two runs that the car makes. It has been created to recognize the team that has designed and most understands the performance of the reaction that powers the car.
Spirit of the Competition - This award is given to the team displaying the most team spirit as decided by a panel of judges.
Most Creative Drive System - Recognition is awarded to the team that has designed and installed the most creative driving system. The winner is decided by a panel of judges during the poster competition. 

</li><li>The competition will be conducted on the honor system. Faculty can only act as sounding boards to the student queries. The faculty cannot be idea generators for the project.

</li><li>The maximum team size is 3 participants. All team members do not have to be present at the competition; however, all are encouraged to try and attend.
</li>
