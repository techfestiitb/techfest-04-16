<p>The Indian Navy will be actively participating in Techfest 2004. 
The Western Naval Command of the Indian Navy shall 
be putting up an exhibition displaying the static and working models as well as actual ship-borne equipment showcasing
the cutting edge technology that has made the Indian Navy one of the
strongest and most respected forces world wide. The aims of the exhibition would be :- </p><img src=../images/navy1.jpg align=right 
vspace=20 hspace=20>

<ul type=a><li>To depict the wide spectrum of technologies used in the Navy.<br></li><br>
<li> To instill a greater sense of patriotism and national integrity in the
youth.<br></li><br>
<li>To enhance awareness of the youth in particular, to the multifarious
activities of one of the most formidable navies in the world.<br></li><br>
</ul>
<p>The theme of the exhibition will be built upon the basic functions of a
warship. The exhibits will give an insight into the complex technologies
which contribute to making the ship into a cohesive, self- contained,
fighting unit. Equipment being displayed would depict the four essential
facets of a warship which are :-</p>

<ul><li><b>To Float: </b>What make these HUGE machines of war float? Hull design (all you're authorised to know), dry docking (repair) and more.<br></li><br>

<li><b>To Move:</b> Propulsion. Huge propellers (these ships may give a few
speedboats a run for their money). Engines the size of a small house.<br></li><br>
<li><b>
To Seek:</b> Radars, infra red, sensors. The works. Gadgets that serve as the
captains eyes in times of war.<br></li><br>

<li><b>To Destroy:</b> Guns, missiles, torpedos. This is how the navy takes its
enemies down. A rare opportunity to get a glimpse of these weapons.<br></li><br></ul>

<p>Every branch of  engineering, be it  Mechanical, Marine, Metallurgical,
Electronics, Electrical, Informatics and many more, plays a significant
role in the design, construction and operation of a warship. The
exhibition is designed to give a flavour of the varied spectrum of
involved technologies, not only in the many fields of Engineering, but
also in the evolution of the  associated equipment, right from the mid-90s
to the present state-of-art.</p>
<p>There will also be photographs, exhibits and banners depicting life in the
navy and various extracurricular activities. All in all an excellent opportunity to sneak a glimpse of what the navy is all about.</p>
<p>The exhibition will be inaugurated by Rear Admiral S. K. K. Krishnan, AVSM,
VSM, Admiral Superintendent, Naval Dockyard, Mumbai on  24 Jan 2004.
