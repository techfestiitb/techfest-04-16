Techfest, the annual science and technology festival of IIT Bombay, since
its inception in 1998, has grown to be the biggest of it's kind in the
whole of Asia. This year, Techfest takes a giant leap into the realm of
the international.<br><br>
In Techfest, nothing ever happens on a small scale, with international
events, lectures by A.P.J. Abdul Kalaam, R. Chidambaram, Mr. Richard
Stallman etc, and prizes exceeding <b>Rs 7,00,000</b>, Techfest has always lived
upto all levels of expectations. We invite you to share our vision with us
- a Celebration of Technology.

A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on. This is
the philosophy behind Competitions, the linchpin of the events at
Techfest. Competitions endeavours to encourage students in giving shape to
their bright and innovative ideas. It provides an ideal podium for young
minds to put flesh-and-blood into the figments of their creative thinking.
Competitions at Techfest believe in preparing the youth for the future by
providing them a sneak-peek into the new world of morrow through contests
which deal with situations capable of revolutionizing the society. Another
truly commendable feature of Competitions is that it brings out the
ultimate in terms of competitive spirit by pitting the best of the
paticipants against each other.

<a href=main.php?file=yantriki/yantriki.php class=grey1link><b>YANTRIKI</b></a><br><blockquote>
Nothing in Techfest is on a small scale and Yantriki stands a proud
testament to that fact. From a humble beginning, it has grown in huge
leaps and bounds to become by far India's largest robotics competition,
attracting participation of more than 100 colleges from all over the
country.

<a href=main.php?file=cliffhanger/cliffhanger.php class=grey1link><b>CLIFFHANGER</b></a><br><blockquote>
TechFest adds to an already very impressive bag of events, Cliffhanger, a
robotics event with a problem statement that is going to challenge
students not only from India, but from all over the world. Participants
will have to build a machine that can climb a rope and after reaching the
top, burst the maximum number of balloons. As if that weren't nerve
racking enough, on the opposite side of the "cliff", another participant
is trying to do the same thing, only better.
<br><br>
With prizes exceeding US <b>$2500 </b>including those for special categories like
aesthetic design, Cliffhanger is going to be one event that is going to
keep thousands of people on the edges of their seats. Don't miss it!

<a href=main.php?file=chemsplash/chemsplash.php class=grey1link><b>CHEMSPLASH</b></a><br><blockquote>
A chemical engineering extravaganza, Chemsplash has been a part of
Techfest since 2000. From a mere idea in 2000, Chemsplash has grown from
strength to strength and this year we are proud to present five
brain-racking contests in Chemsplash. The global chemical industry is
transforming itself by placing at its centre the concerns for human safety
and welfare, environmental protection, energy conservation and higher
efficiency. These are some of the burning issues on which Chemsplash 2004
focusses its concern.

<a href=main.php?file=laststraw/laststraw.php class=grey1link><b>LAST STRAW</b></a><br><blockquote>An event known to follow the motto "Simple yet Stimulating", Last Straw is
simplicity at its best. An altogether unique event of its kind, most
events in Last Straw, as the name suggests, require only straws as the
starting material (with a little glue to stick 'em up, of course).

If you thought Techfest 2004 is going to last three days from January 24th
