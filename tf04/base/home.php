Techfest 2004 is going <i>international</i></a> and is scheduled 
from 24th-26th January, 2004.</p>
<p>Techfest portrays the vivid spectrum of science and technology and how 
it
  is affecting our every-day lives. Whether it is the latest and the best 
in
  R&amp;D, lectures by some of the most eminent personalities from myriad 
fields
  like science, technology and management, innovative and exciting
  competitions or workshops on riveting topics, they are all to be found

<p>It is of utmost importance to realize that boundaries are mere 
perceptions. 
  The shattering of constraints and barriers imposed on oneself is the 
first step 
  to realizing the boundless infinity of the fascinating world of science 
and 
  technology. Creative thought and vision sow the seed of progress - but 
it is 
  opportunity and constant endeavour which nourishes development. </p>
<p>Techfest seeks to initiate and further this spirit in the vibrant and 
dynamic 
  student community. Techfest 2004 endeavors to bear aloft the torch of 
the future 
  which has been lit and passed down through six years of Techfest. We 
invite 
  you to share our dream and realize its fruition with us. </p>
