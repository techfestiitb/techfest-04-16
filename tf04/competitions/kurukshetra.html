<img src=kurukshetra/upload1.jpg border=0 hspace=20 vspace=20 align=right>
The holy war of Mahabharata was fought in Kurukshetra between the Kauravas 
  and Pandavas. 5000 years down the line the ashes from the war give rise to a 
  game where softwares developed by the competitors battle it out to achieve complete 
  supremacy over each other in a mind blowing combat. The battle field has been 
  restored, only the warriors have changed. Now the fight is not that of &quot;Good 
  vs Evil&quot; but of &quot;Grey Cells and programming skills of each contestant 
  against another&quot;.The contestants will be required to programme their own 
  Robots in Java which will engage in the struggle for survival and victory. The 
  ultimate goal is the complete demolition of your opponents robots and all you 
  need to ensure that is sheer genius and a bit of Java.<br>

Total Cash Prize of Rs. <b>12,000</b> to be won.  <br><br>

purpose. <br><br></li><li> In the screening stage, a robot will be made to
fight against  other robots in the game of three round each and the
best 20 robots will be selected, who would be allowed to come on the day of
