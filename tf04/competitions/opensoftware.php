 &#8216;Programming 
today is a 
race 
between software 
engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe 
trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.&#8217; 
<strong>Open Software</strong> invites all the software wizards to bring forth 
  any software designed, developed and coded by them. Participants have the liberty 
  to code in any language based on Windows / Unix / Linux. Software which has 
  been used commercially is not acceptable for the competition. Judges will consider 
  <strong>innovation, type of problem chosen, marketability</strong> and <strong>presentation</strong> 
  of the software while judging.<br><br>
  This year we are introducing <i>special category prizes</i> for the 
  best softwares answering any <i>social cause</i>.</p>
<p>The participant will have all rights over his/her software.<br>
  Source code shall not be made open to anyone except the judges, if the participant 
  so desires.<br>
Total Cash Prize of Rs. <b>25,000</b> to be won.</p>

  We would provide you with computers with required operating system and softwares 
  (preferably the latest versions.). It would be convenient if you carry your 
  CPU as compatibility problems may come up at the last moment. Other necessary 
  things like monitor, keyboard, mouse etc would be provided. <strong>All the 
  participants should communicate these requirements along with the abstracts 
  for the screening round.</strong></p>
