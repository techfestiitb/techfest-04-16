<ul>
<li>The Beginning Was Humble but Last straw has grown rapidly to become a full fledged event in just couple of years
<li>When it debuted in year 1999 it was just limited to Civil Engineering Department of IIT Bombay.But then Due to overwhelming interest shown by the participants it grew enormously.And now it is the Major <a href="main.php?file=competitions/competitions.php">competition</a> in <strong>Techfest.</strong>
<li>Laststraw aims at building Powerful Structures Capable of lifting Heavy weights without crumbling using lightest of Straws.
<li>It tests the Basic designing capability of the Participant along with the capacity of using minimum material for making best of the structures.
<li>LastYear we had two Events-
<ul type="square">
<li><strong>Event1-</strong>Design a building using straws supplied by us that carries maximum
under a specific earthquake base excitation.
<li><strong>Event2-</strong>Design a working model of a bridge as light as possible using straws
supplied by us to carry maximum moving load</li>
<p>All these srtuctures had to be made by straws only using pins.The overlap allowed between the straws was upto 2cm.</p>
</ul>
<li>The problem statement has not been decided yet.
</ul>
