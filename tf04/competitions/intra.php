<p>
Competitions at Techfest are aimed to pit students against the best
opposition in the country. The challenges in the competition try not only
stimulate and bring out the creative genius in the participants but also
make it a fun and learning experience for the participants.
<br><br>
In this endeavour of exposing the student to more and more interesting and
innovative stuff, the competitions within IIT Bombay are not restricted to
just the 3 days of Techfest but run through out the year as intra-IIT
competitions. While a few of them provide a flavour to what will be
unvieled in Techfest, most of them are run-ups to the major events like
Yantriki, Chemsplash, Last Straw etc.
The intra-IIT events at Techfest 2004 include:
