   We would provide computers if and only if required. Participants are required to bring stuff like adapters, 
batteries, extension cords etc by themselves. Also, they must carry their CPU with the required softwares installed for 
design demonstrations (if required) as compatibility problems may arise at the last moment. Other necessary things like 
monitor, keyboard, mouse etc would be provided. All the participants should communicate these requirements along with 
the abstracts for the screening round.
