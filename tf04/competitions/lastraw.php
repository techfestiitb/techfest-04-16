<br> <br> <p>From ancient Greece ... to present
day London and somewhere in between we take you on a short trip to Krypton and back!!! Welcome to the enigmatical
journey, that we call last straw. The annual extravaganza organized by Techfest 2004. Please fasten your seat belts, as
we take you on a short trip through our world...<br><br>

planet
Krypton the sole survivor of the entire civilization was transported to earth ... is it a bird ... is it a plane ... no
wait ... its superman!!! 
Ever wondered how the hyper light drive rocket that got us our superman, survives the impact
with earth? The answer.
 To find out more, we at Techfest 2004 would like to invite you all to join us in our endeavor of
furthering mankind's knowledge on the uniform load distribution of a structure. Here's an invitation to all to
participate in the load distribution competition. The main aim of which is to build a structure that can distribute the
load of an impact uniformly throughout it, without the structure itself failing. The more the impact absorption, the
more efficient will be the design.

<b>The Seize of Syracuse</b></a><br><br><blockquote>
'When Romans attacked the city of Syracuse, King Helios approached the great
mathematician Archimedes for help! Archimedes single-handedly destroyed the entire Roman fleet with the help of huge
poles thrusting out from the walls which sunk some ships by great weights which they let down upon them; some ships he
lifted up to a great height in the air (a dreadful thing to behold), and rolled them to and fro, and finally dashing
them against the rocks, or letting them fall into the sea.'
These lines, written by Plutarch, have been a
source of wonder and amazement for millennia, partly because Archimedes never wrote how he accomplished these tasks.
Perhaps he used levers and pulleys or some method of which we know nothing as yet. To lift boulders, is one thing but
ships! That too from the confines of the city, more than 2000 years ago is no child's play. So we at IIT Bombay decided
to try and recreate Archimedes's machine warriors and what better way to do so than by holding a competition!

<br><br> Well instead of asking people to lift ships out of the sea with gigantic cranes, we scaled down the event, for
your convenience, to lifting smaller... much smaller... weights, but don't worry we won't let you bring any of those
4000 tones cranes either. Instead you'll have to make your crane out of straws!! (a bit of the present did creep into
the recreation of the past).
 Well that's that and that's our event. We gotta, rather you gotta make a crane illustrated
in the diagram following the given set of rules-this is just so that everyone makes the same approximation of the size
of Archimedes's city, and your aim ... to lift a roman ship aka given load, transport it over the given wall; well we do
not have any cliffs around here to dash the ships against; and place it safely on the other side. What say, anybody
game!!!
