In the present day world, the growing importance of the field of robotics cannot be overemphasized. Robotics 
motivates multiple areas of science and technology, combining elements of computer science, mathematics, physical 
sciences, and engineering. Yantriki, the nation's premier robotics competition, is the first and foremost college 
level competition in India that offers young robotics enthusiasts and connoisseurs the platform to gain invaluable 
experience both with the technology and the practical elements that go into the making/automation of a robot. And 
what's more! It's a whole lot of fun!
<br>
The next few lines provide a sneak preview into the progress of Yantriki over the years.

<p><b>Level 1:</b> In this level, two machines competed against each other at one time. There were three napkins 
in 
middle 
of the wooden board. The machine had to pick a napkin and put it in its 
home. The one that could get maximum napkins 
home won.<br> 
<b>Level 2:</b> Table Tennis - Two machines played a game of table tennis against one another with certainly 
deviously 
modified rules.<br>
<b>Level 3:</b> Micro mouse - Participants had to make an autonomous machine that could solve an intricate maze. 
The 
machine that took the shortest time won.

<p>For the first time, Yantriki experimented with three different competitions, with successively cumbersome 
problem 
statements.<br>
<b>Level 1:</b> Obstacle car race - Two contesting machines will be on a mission to overcome difficulties of 
terrain to 
reach their goal. Each remote controlled machine had to begin its journey from its base on an elevated platform; 
jump onto a sand bed at the end of the platform and then climb onto an inclined plane. Following its specified 
path, the machine had to steer clear of obstacles and get into the garage on the platform. The one that reached 
the goal first was the winner. And, of course, the machines were forbidden from intentionally damaging or 
attacking their opponents!
<br>
<b>Level 2:</b> Racing with a twist - The robot had to hang/cling onto two guide pipes like a cable car. Rest of 
the 
track is similar to the first level.
<br>
<b>Level 3:</b> An autonomous robot was provided with marbles. Its job was to find a hollow cylinder attached in 
the 
middle of the board and drop the marbles in it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>"X-terra"</b> - the obstacle race - was to be the problem statement. The robots had to dodge umpteen obstacles 
of 
varying degrees of difficulty. For the first time, Yantriki was organized as a part of Techfest.

<p>As the millennium bell rang, Yantriki performed an X-gen somersault of kinds. IIT Bombay witnessed the 
participation of a record number of 134 participants. And the occasion was marked by high intensity games of 
robotic <b>"water polo"</b>. The aim of the competition was to make a robot that could play Water Polo. The 
machines of 
this round were autonomous; and once in water they had to do the thinking and acting all by themselves.
</p>
<font color=if3d55><b>1999</b></font>
<p> A phenomenal year! The number of participating teams crossed the exceptional 100 figure for the first time. 
This 
year, the competition wore a distinct Japanese flavour, what with the robots having to duel in `<b>Sumo 
Wrestling</b>'
. Participants had to make Sumo Wrestlers that would fight in a circular ring in a three-minute contest, and the 
fastest, strongest and the most agile won the bout. 
</p><font color=if3d55><b>1998</b></font>
<p>The competition burgeoned, in a matter of just two years both with the number of participators and the 
excitement 
the event brought rose mercurially. The participating robots fought it out in the "<b>Carro Mines"</b>. Mine field 
was 
simulated by placing carrom coins on the two halves of a board, the halves separated by uniformly spaced wooden 
blocks, the objective being to fling the mines into the opponent's half.
 <br>
Yantriki '98 had three levels of competitions. "<b>Soldier Level</b>" in which machines were manually controlled, 
"<b>Commando Level</b>" which involved manually controlled machines but with obstacles in each half. The third 
level of 
the competition was "The Autonomous Level", in which machines had to play against each other autonomously.

<p>The second coming of the event saw the staging of "<b>Bunny Wars</b>". This competition generated immense 
enthusiasm 
and 
fun, both among the participants as well as the spectators, as the miniature machines - "rabbits" - battled each 
other to gather the maximum "fruits" from the table top "garden".   
 </p>
<font color=if3d55><b>1996   The en·trée</b></font> 
<p>In the year of its inception as an inter-college competition, Yantriki had enthusiastic participants make 
basket-ball players out of robots. Machines had to dodge competitors and basket the ball.
