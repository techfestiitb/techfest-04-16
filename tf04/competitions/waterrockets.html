Imagine a gadget that flies to heights which rival solid-motor powered model rockets! And all you need is a little scrap material and a meager knowledge of 'rocket science'. If you haven't guessed what we are talking about, then it is indeed your turn to be amazed at this simple and elegant technology -- <strong>the water rocket</strong>.  <br><br>

This surprisingly unsophisticated rocket employs a compressed gas to accelerate water through its nozzle as a means of propulsion. The body of the rocket is just another ubiquitous plastic bottle. All you need to do in layman's language is fill the bottle halfway through with water, pressurize with air, invert it and watch the fun!! However, not everything is child's play 'coz you will have to build your own launcher and optimize
the rocket for various parameters. Also, there is an element of risk involved with these seemingly innocuous toys 'coz they might pack enough power in them to cause injuries if ever the rockets go out of control. Please take the safety precautions seriously.<br><br>

In its second avatar, Water Rockets in Techfest 2004 presents you with yet another challenging problem.

Statement:</b></font></a><br><br>
Design and construct a water propelled rocket to be launched at any angle
less than 75 degrees measured from horizontal. Maximum time of flight will
be the winning criteria. A launcher also needs to be constructed which
should be able to launch the rocket safely. <br><br><br><br>
  <a name=rules><font color=#293932><b>Genral Rules:</b></font></a><br>
  
<ol>
  <li>Students currently enrolled for up to an undergraduate/postgraduate program 
    at their institute are eligible for the competition.<br><br></li>
  <li>Number of members per team should not exceed three.<br>
    <br></li>
  <li>Every team has to <a href=../register/allregister1.php?comp=lms class=greylink>register</a> 
    online at our website for the competition. A registration number will be allocated 
    to the team on registration which shall be used for future reference.<br><br></li>
  <li>There will be an elimination round for the competition during Techfest
before the final round.<br><br></li>
  <li> Three trials will be given to each entry and the best time of the three 
    will be considered for judging for both the elimination as well as the final 
    round.<br><br></li>
  <li> Participants are allowed to use different rockets for these three trials.<br><br></li>
  <li> Participants if qualify for finals, are permitted to use a different rocket 
    from the one using which they cleared the elimination round.<br><br></li>
  <li> Participants selected for the finals will have to give an introduction 
    before the judges about the design of the rocket, launcher and the scientific 
    principles used in construction of the rocket. The introduction has to be 
    very brief.<br><br></li>
  <li> If the rocket fails to satisfy the safety norms in any of the trials, it 
    will be counted as a missed trial.<br><br></li>
  <li> The launching mechanism should be such that the participant remains at 
    a safe distance of at least 2 meters while launching. <br><br></li>
  <li> Participants can use various mechanisms like parachutes etc. to increase 
    the time of flight.<br><br></li>
  <li> Participants are allowed to bring their own pumps. A standard pump along 
    with the pressure gauge shall be made available details of which will be put 
    up here soon.<br><br></li>
  <li> All methods of compressing air are to be manual i.e. with a foot or bicycle 
    pump. <br><br></li>
  <li> Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.<br><br>
  </li>
</ol><br>
<br><a name=con><font color=#293932><b>Other Constraints:</b></font></a><br>
<ol>
  <li>Only water should be used as the propellant. No other gas than air is allowed 
    to be pressurized and provide thrust to the rocket.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There is no restriction to the size of the bottle/container to be used for 
    the rocket but only one bottle should be used or in other words only single 
    stage rockets are allowed for the competition.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Maximum launching pressure allowed is 5 Bars.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>No ready made products like nose-cones, fin etc. should be used for the 
    rocket. The rocket body has to be completely self-made. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ready made parts like washers, clips, ties etc. are allowed to be used for 
    the launcher, but the assembly has to be self made. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>External metal parts are allowed on the launch mechanism but not on the 
    rocket. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>All energy imparted to the rocket must originate from the water/air pressure 
    combination. No other potential, kinetic or any other source of energy will 
    be permitted.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> The launcher must remain stationary on ground while and after the launching 
    of the rocket.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Rocket components may separate during the flight but are not allowed to 
    detach completely from the rocket. For example, if a nose cone is used, it 
    can separate, but should remain attached to the rocket body.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li> Each rocket will be fired from the edge of the landing zone towards the 
    center. The dimensions of the landing zone will soon be available.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Timing of the rocket stops as soon as any part of the rocket touches the 
    ground, or when the rocket disappears from the judge&#8217;s sight, or when 
    the rocket gets entangled with an object (e.g. the rocket collides with a 
    tree).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Bottle chosen to construct the rocket should withstand the high launching 
    pressure. Aerated cold drink bottles are suggested for the rocket. It is to 
    be noted that standard cold drink bottles (Pepsi, Coke etc) can withstand 
    a maximum of 8 bars of pressure.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br><br>
  <a name=hints><font color=#293932><b>Hints & Tips:</b></font></a> 
<br>
<ol>
  <li>To keep rocket more aerodynamically stable there is a rule of thumb that 
    states that the Centre of Drag (CoD) should be between 1-2 times the distance 
    equal to the rocket diameter, behind the Centre of Gravity (CoG) .Where CoD 
    can be found by making a cardboard cut-out of the sideways view of the rocket 
    and finding its centre of gravity. <br><br></li>
  <li>To lower CoD you can use wings or to rise CoG try using weights at Nose 
    of Rocket.<br><br></li>
  <li>Try using different kinds of nozzle, as nozzle size determines heights and 
    speed achieved. (water hoses, bottle caps with modification, even open bottles 
    themselves can be used as nozzles) <br><br></li>
  <li>Use mathematical models to calculate correct water amounts to be used for 
    specific bottle size and pressure used to get maximum heights or initial acceleration. <br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Try to design some good mechanism of filling water in the bottle to decrease 
    loss of water during mounting rocket bottle on launcher (water need not to 
    be filled before mounting but can be one possibility), this will also give 
    u good approximation of flight beforehand. <br><br></li>
  <li>To increase the time you can use parachutes or try reducing the nozzle size 
    to decrease the velocity of rockets.<br><br></li>
  <li>For launching the rocket, you can use cable ties to hold bottle in vertical 
    direction (But many more methods too are available, try search on www.google.com.) <br><br>
  </li>
  <li> Cable ties can also play major role in launching rocket from safe distance 
    (Even some holding ring mechanisms are also available). <br><br></li>
  <li> Try using smaller diameter pipes than major body for making variable height 
    of tubes. <br><br>
      </li>
