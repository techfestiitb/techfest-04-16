<ul>
<li>
<b>What kind of shapes can the zones take?
</b><br><br>
 Any shape is permissible as long as it is convex i.e. if line is drawn joining any two points on the boundary it should lie completely inside the region.
</li><br><br><br>
<li>
<b> How to take out the centers of the zones? 
</b><br><br>
 If the zones are of symmetrical shape then you can taje out the center using geometry and if it is irregular in shape its center can be taken out by calculating the center of the largest inscribed circle of that zone.
</li><br><br><br>
<li>
<b> Does the width of the rail track affect the cost of constructing the road over railway line?
</b><br><br>
 No, the width of the track is very small and it wont effect the construction cost of the road. However there will be a fixed extra construction cost which you will have to incur every time you make a road over the railway line and its data are given in the problem statement.
</li><br><br><br>
<li>
 <b>Can the railway track pass through a region i.e. will a region be split into two different zones by the railway track?
</b><br><br>
 No, the railway track cannot pass through any zone. It will be considered two different zones.
</li><br><br><br>
<li>
<b> Will a region be considered split into two different zones by the river?
</b><br>
<br>
 Yes the regions on either side of the river will be considered as two different zones.
</li><br><br><br>
<li>
<b> While considering movement of people from one zone to another can I use Railways as one of the means of Transport?
</b><br>
<br>
 No, Railways are used only for going out of the city. It can not be considered for traveling from one zone to another.


</li><br><br><br>
<li>
 <b>What is a spanning tree road network?
</b><br><br>
 In a spanning tree road network there is just one way of connecting two zones
i.e. no loops are allowed. This is not what is done practically, but this network system is used to study the road network problems are basic levels and hence as part of this network crossroads are not allowed, however road over road bridges are allowed and have to be clearly specified in the solution sheet being submitted by the participant.

</li><br><br><br>
<li><b>What all do we have to submit before 10th Jan. Does that include power point presentation along with AUTOCAD files? </b><br><br>For the first round you need to submit Auto cad file of the design and the cost estimation excel sheets. Power point slides are only for the second round if you get through the first round.</li><br><br><br>
<li><b>What is the significance of contours and heights ?</b></li><br><br>
Contours and heights for the hilly region are insignificant as they are not prominent enough to have any impact on any of the parameters involved in designing the city.</li><br><br><br>
<li><b>Will it be fine to include any entertainment spots in the plan in the outskirts?</b></li><br><br>
You need not include them in the plan. In case you do so it would not deserve any extra credit.
