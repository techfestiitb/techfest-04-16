<div align="left"><b><h3>GREAVITY MODEL</h3></b>
</div>
<br> For decades, social scientists 
have been using a modified version of Isaac
Newton's Law of Gravitation to predict movement of people, information, 
and commodities between cities and even
continents.  <br><br> The gravity model, as social scientists refer to the 
modified law of gravitation, takes into
account the population size of two places and their distance. Since larger 
places attract people, ideas, and commodities
more than smaller places and places closer together have a greater 
attraction, the gravity model incorporates these two
features.  <br><br> The relative strength of a bond between two places is 
determined by multiplying the population of
zone A by the population of zone B and then dividing the product by the 
distance between the two cities squared <br><br>
<pre> 
                             A<sub>1</sub>      A<sub>2</sub>                   A<sub>n</sub>
Let 'F' be some constant =  ---  +  ---  + ---------- +  ---
                             d<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>     d<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>                  d<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup>
</pre>
Then the Gravity Model is:<font color=red><pre>
             P<sub>i</sub> X A<sub>j</sub>
       Tij = --------
             F x d<sub>ij</sub><sup>2</sup>
</pre>
</font>
<pre>
Where:   T<sub>ij</sub>   = no. of people going from zone (i) and to zone (j)
         P<sub>i</sub>    = total number of people going out from Residential zone (i)
         A<sub>j</sub>    = total people working in zone (j)
         d<sub>ij</sub>   = road distance between zones i and j.
</pre>
</p>
<b>User Money between zone i and zone j</b> = T<sub>ij</sub> X d<sub>ij</sub> X C<br>
where C is the cost of travelling and is expressed in Rs. per km and in our case it can be taken to be Rs. 6 per km.<br>
