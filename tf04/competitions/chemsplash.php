<p>Chemsplash is THE annual event for chem enthusiasts. From what started 
of 
as a mere idea in the year 2000 has blossomed into an event which is now 
the biggest event of its kind in India.It now boosts of participation of 200 teams from all over the country, battling over competitions like 
Chem-e-car, Chemisoft (The open software contest), Turbulence (The quiz 
contest) and TechnumOpus (The poster presentation contest) for prizes 
worth 50 grand.

What is the driving force behind Chemsplash?</b>
<br><br>
Chemical Engineering is a creation of the 20th Century. We have had a
century in which Chemical engineering has blossomed, developed,
transformed itself, and perhaps matured. We are now in a new century, Chemical Engineering's second century, and already challenges are driving vast changes in our industries, their methods of operation, their requirements of Chemical Engineers-indeed,society's requirements of Chemical Engineers-and the educational
approaches and tools we can and need to use. The chemical process Industry has been the engine behind the growth of wealth of nations. The global chemical industry is transforming itself by
placing at its centre the concerns for human safety and welfare,
environmental protection, energy conservation and higher efficiency. And
in this endeavor of reinventing itself the chemical industry is rapidly
imbibing the benefits of the ongoing Information Technology revolution. In
short, our profession is in a state of heady flux! And thus, our times can at once appear confusing as well as stupendously
potent! So, what are the dominant evolutionary strands today in the
chemical engineering profession? We need to reflect and sift the true from
the apparent. This real world practice of our profession is made in the
events of Chemsplash, which itself is a true handmaiden of progress.

<p>
This year, we have introduced a new event called High Spirits which is bound to stimulate your grey cells!
<br>
<br>
A brief description of the events we have in Chemplash 2004 :
</p>

<li><font color=if3d55><b>la porsChe :</b></font>
<img src="competitions/chem-car.jpg" align="right">
<p> The objective of this hugely successful competition is to design and
construct a car that is powered with a chemical energy source that will
carry a load to a given distance and stop by exhausting the power source
or cutting of the power without the application of brakes or electronic
mechanism (so here you need to trust those whimsical chemicals!!!!). The
car will be Judged based on the combination of completion of a defined
task and a judging of the most creative design.
</p>

<li><font color=if3d55><b>High Spirits :</b></font>
<p> The objective of this competition is to build a structure that can lift heavy loads to a given height (+/- the tolerance limit) using chemical energy. The lifts will be judged based on the maximum load they can lift in a pre-defined number of trials. Importance will be also be given to the creative and safety aspects of the lifts.

<!--<p>Some examples are: <br><br><blockquote><img src="competitions/chemecar1.jpg"

<li><font color=if3d55><b>TechnumOpus :</b></font>
<p> This is the poster presentation contest at Chemsplash. 
Here you get an opportunity to present a paper on any topic related to
the world of chemistry / chemical engineering. Entries will be short listed
based upon an abstract which all the teams have to send a month before
Techfest commences.
</p>
<li><font color=if3d55><b>Workshops :</b></font>
<!--<img src="competitions/2000a.jpg" align="right">-->
<p> The aim of this workshop is to give the students a hands on 
experience of what is the latest in the field of Chemical Engineering. 
Experienced faculty / people from the industry will guide the participants through the latest technology that is being used worldwide.
</p>
<li><font color=if3d55><b>Lecture Series :</b></font>
<p> 
Did you know that Chemical Engineers got the most number of jobs than any other discipline in the US last year? Neither did we. Until we attended the lecture series. Last year the lecture series consisted of a set of 4 renowned speakers, lecturing on topics like `Careers in Chemical Engineering' and `Multi-disciplinarian approach towards Chemical Engineering'.
</p>

<li><font color=if3d55><b>Turbulence :</b></font>
<p>
This is the quiz competition at ChemSplash. It consists of a written eliminations round, followed by the finals, which will consist
of several interesting rounds like visual round, buzzer round, the normal
questions round and rapid fire at the end.
