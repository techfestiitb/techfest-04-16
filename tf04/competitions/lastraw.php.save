<p>Starting from a humble intra IIT event to going national, Last Straw has
surely come a long way and has many a miles ahead of it. The story so far
has been phenomenally successful and it continues to scale even greater
heights.
<br>
A brief overview of the success story that we call LAST STRAW.

Last Straw 2003 enjoyed overwhelming participation from every nook and
corner of the country.
<br>
The two main competitions of last straw 2003 were:
<br>
EVENT 1 : This event comprised of building a tower out of straws. The
tower was then loaded and subjected to vibrations at the base, thus
simulating earthquake conditions. The challenge lay in maintaining the
intactness of the structure throughout and after the stress test.
<br>
EVENT 2 : This event required the participants to design a bridge model
connecting two support points.
<br>
In addition to these two very challenging events, a series of workshops
and lectures were conducted based on GPS-GIS and Transportation.
<br>
Our main sponsors were HCC.

It was in this year that last straw merged with techfest. Also,the doors
were opened to all colleges of the country. The main theme of last straw
2002 was `Conquering The Depths'. The contestants were required to build
a boat, which could carry a load across a one meter long channel.
A workshop on GPS/GIS was also organized that met with an overwhelming
response.
<br>
The main sponsor for this year was HCC.

This was an important year in the history of Last Straw. The competition
was open to all colleges of Mumbai. The problem statement was the same
as that of the previous year .There was an overall participation of 150
teams from the various colleges of Mumbai and also the interests of
various civil engineering companies. The tremendous response was a clear
indication of the crossing of another milestone.

<p><font color="#iF3d55"><b>Last Straw 2000</font></b><br><br>
This time around the event was open to all students of IIT Bombay. The
problem statement was to build a bridge of straw which would then be
attached to a panel. The design of the structure was tested by making a
loaded truck run over the panel.
<br>
The event saw promising participation from most students here. All in all,
it was a big success and this paved the way for achieving further
milestones.

Last Straw made its dynamic debut this year. It started off as a contest
open only to the students of Civil Engineering Department of IIT Bombay.
The task was to build a tower which was loaded laterally with a fixed
base. The structures were tested in the Experimantal Stress Analysis
Laboratory.
<br>
The overall success of the event, ensured its growing over the years and
turn out to be the grand success as it stands today.
