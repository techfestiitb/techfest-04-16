        The importance of cryptography goes far beyond providing data
secrecy. As data transmission and processing become more automated, and
the information flow becomes more intense, cryptographic methods gain
greater importance. To date there exists well known and approved crypto
algorithms, both symmetric and asymmetric, whose strength is either
mathematically proved or based on mathematically hard computational
problems (factorization, discrete logarithm, etc). The most famous ones
are DES, GOST, and RSA. These algorithms can be broken only by solving
this problem or by brute force. On the other hand, information on errors
and flaws in one or the other program or on cracking some programs,
including those using crypto algorithms, appears in computer world and
about all the time. It causes distrust to both the specific programs and
ability to protect anything with cryptography in general, not only against
secret services, but also against hackers. Thus when designing secure
systems it is necessary to learn history of attacks and flaws in
cryptosystems and to understand the reasons of their occurrence. The
promising research branch in this field is the analysis of successful
attacks or detected cryptosystem vulnerabilities in order to generalize,
classify and detect the reasons and regularity of their appearance and
existence. The intent is not to low-rate anyone's products; the objectives
are to:
<blockquote>        Provide a few data points on cryptographic strength,
        Help assess risk exposure in your environment, and
        Help developers avoid common mistakes in new implementation
</blockquote><br>
        By analogy with computer systems security violation reasons
taxonomy, there are many reasons for which cryptographic programs cannot
be considered secure. Note that reasons in concern cover only two
potential threats, namely confidentiality and integrity ones, leaving
aside denial of service, which becomes more and more significant with the
development of distributed cryptosystems. For example, though many systems
are broken because they rest on passwords decided by the user who will not
choose strong passwords of which it will not be able to remember. Some
interfaces of uses still make worsen the problem: they limit the passwords
to eight characters, convert all in small letters, and so on. Even the key
sentences can be weak: to seek sentences of 40 characters is often easier
than to seek random keys of 64 bits. It is on this principle that bases
itself the majority of bruteforcing, jointly using a dictionary, and an
alpha-numeric search.
