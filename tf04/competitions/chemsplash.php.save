<p>By all reckoning, our human civilization is a very complex reality today and is growing ever more so. And in its
wake, there is a growing need to manage the complexity through continuous
 and rapid refinements of technology. This is perhaps evident most strongly 
in the chemical process Industry, the industry which has been the engine behind the growth 
of wealth of nations. The global chemical industry is transforming itself by placing at its centre 
the concerns for human safety and welfare, environmental protection, energy conservation and higher
 efficiency. And in this endeavor of reinventing itself the chemical industry is rapidly imbibing 
the benefits of the ongoing Information Technology revolution. In short, our profession is in a state of heady flux! 
</p>
<p>And thus, our times can at once appear confusing as well as stupendously potent! So, what are 
the dominant evolutionary strands today in the chemical engineering profession? We need to reflect and 
sift the true from the apparent. So that the real world practice of our profession is made 
in the events for Chemsplash, which is a true handmaiden of progress.
