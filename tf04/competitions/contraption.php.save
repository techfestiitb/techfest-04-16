<p><font size=2 px>&#8216;Optimization hinders evolution.&#8217; </font></p>
<p>
  Every scientific development in today&#8217;s world is an effort to make things 
  simpler. Ever thought of going the other way? We call it the Dexter&#8217;s 
  way.</p>
<p>To burst just a balloon, Dexter opens his lab window, lets sunlight in which 
  activates a solar panel. The power from the panel drives a motor fan which blows 
  the flame of a candle kept near a string. The string burns thus releasing a 
  pin attached to a pendulum which ultimately bursts the balloon placed in the 
  pin&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>Whew! <br>
  Sensible? &#8230; No. <br>
  Exciting? &#8230; Definitely YES!</p>
<p>All you have to do is to perform a trivial task in most complex and intriguing 
  manner. 
  Go ahead &#8230;do something you never did before &#8230;make life tougher!</p>
