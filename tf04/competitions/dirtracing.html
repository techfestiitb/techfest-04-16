Ever played the 
video-game ExciteBike? Watched the rider zip across all the dirt-tracks, 
swamps et al without much ado? Wanted to do something in real life like that? Then here's a golden opportunity to do it 'coz this year Techfest 2004 presents the more exciting and enchanting version of ExciteBike --- Dirt Car Racing. For the uninitiated, one of the oldest forms of motorsport and invented in the United States in the early 20th century, dirt speedway racing involves vehicles racing each other round dirt-surfaced lightly-banked oval tracks. Originally stock car and Indycar racing were varieties of this, but diverged with the development of hard-surfaced superspeedways. Dirt Racing at Techfest 2004 digresses a little from the normal mode of racing by allowing single races and timing the vehicles accordingly. So, all you racing enthusiasts out there, gear up to become part of the first largest <strong>Dirt Car Racing</strong> fiesta in India.<br>Total Cash Prize of Rs. <b>20,000</b> to be won.</p>

<p><a name=problem><strong><font color=#293932>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</font></strong></a><br><blockquote>
Participants have to build a battery powered wireless Remote Controlled
car that can endure the rough and uneven terrain (dirt track) made of
moist clay. Least time taken to traverse the track length will decide the
winner for the competition.</blockquote>
<br>
<p><a name=rules><strong><font color=#293932>GAME RULES:</font></strong></a><br>
<ol><li>Students currently enrolled for up to an undergraduate/postgraduate program at 	their institute are eligible for the competition.<br><br></li>
<li>Each team can have a maximum of three participants.<br><br></li>
<li>Every team has to <a href=../register/allregister1.php?comp=drt class=greylink>register</a> online at our website 
for the competition.<br><br></li>
<li>No portion of the machine (except the remote control antenna) should project out of a 10"x10"x10" cube at any point of the game.<br><br></li>
<li>The machine must use only mechanical power converted from a source of electrical energy. Use of any type of chemical (except batteries) is not allowed.<br><br></li>
<li>The machine should carry its power supply onboard and should be <strong>wireless remote control (RC) operated.</strong><br><br></li>   
<li><strong>Teams may use prefabricated wireless remote control (RC) kits</strong> but rest of the machine should be designed and built by the team.<br><br></li>
<li>All the participants might have to submit their Remote Controllers to the organizers during a race to avoid any chances of interference between similar frequency remotes.<br><br></li>
<li>The teams must adhere to the spirit of healthy competition. <br><br></li>
<li>Judges and organizers reserve the right to modify the rules in order to preserve the spirit of healthy competition.<br><br></li>
<li>If a machine fails to participate in the group photograph (time & venue will be notified at the reporting desk during Techfest) no reimbursement will be given to that machine.<br><br></li>
<li>Gearbox and/or motor assembly of a toy car, or a base of a toy car with its gear box and/or motor as a machine part will disqualify the machine for the competition.<br><br></li>
<li>Lego kits/parts are not allowed.<br><br></li>
</ol></p>
<br>
<p><a name=round><strong><font color=#293932>ELIMINATION 
ROUND:</font></strong></a><br>
<ol><li>Elimination round will consist of time trials of all the machines on the track.<br><br></li>
<li>Elimination rounds are essentially for seeding purpose and to eliminate unsafe machines. Machines will be checked for safety and size prerequisites.<br><br></li>
<li>Machines can be modified after elimination round (but the safety aspect would still require inspection by the judges).<br><br></li>
<li>A machine is required to essentially clear the elimination round only once.<br><br></li></ol></p>
<br>
<p><a name=game><strong><font 
color=#293932>CONTEST RULES:</font></strong></a><br>
<ol><li>The contest will be organized into many rounds (races).<br><br></li>

<li>At the end of each round, the top teams will move forward to the next round. The number of the teams advancing to the next round after each round is left to organizers. discretion.<br><br></li>

<li>In case of tie or ambiguity, the race will be replayed again between those two machines.<br><br></li>
<li>No change of batteries to run the machine will be allowed during a single race.<br><br></li>
<li>There shall be an Elimination round for all the competing machines as mentioned above.<br><br></li>
<li>Also, the machine must be <strong>robust</strong> enough to withstand <strong>multiple races</strong> and uneven terrain of the track.<br><br></li></ol></p>
<br>

<p><a name=track><strong><font 
color=#293932>RACE TRACK:</font></strong></a><br><ol><li>The race track 
will

<li>The race track will be made up of dirt consisting of mostly moist clay plus some other ingredients.<br><br></li>
<li>The race track would have many crests and troughs of variable heights which the machines are expected to negotiate. (Thus, the machines will require a <strong>sufficient clearance </strong>from the ground level.) The race track may also have various turns in its path (hair pin turn, 90 degrees bend etc.) <br><br></li>
<li>The contestants may also expect a few bridges or straight tunnels 
through which the vehicle will need to be maneuvered carefully. A few land 
marks like "loose dirt pools"  and "swamps" etc. are most likely 
too.<br><br></li></ol></p> <br>

<dl><dt>
<a name=safety><font 
color=#293932>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Size/Safety:</font></a></dt><br><br><dd>
The machines will be first checked for size and safety. The machines are 
not allowed to dismember themselves or leave parts on the track. The 
machines must not contain any combustible, corrosive, or otherwise 
dangerous materials for safety reasons. No explosive compression or 
decompression, either internal or external is permitted. There is a risk 
of compressed containers rupturing and creating shrapnel. Any machines 
whose strategy or operation is considered too dangerous shall be 
disqualified by the judges.</dd><br><br>
<dt><a name=break><font
color=#293932>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakdowns/Timeouts:</font></a></dt><br><br><dd>
There is no provision for breakdown or timeouts in this contest. Your 
machine must be sturdy enough to participate in several races. The 
decision of the match referee will be final and binding in all respects. 
But a change of batteries is allowed in between consecutive races. The 
machines may be repaired during off time (i.e. the time when a machine is 
not expected to be on the race track).</dd><br><br>
<dt><a name=foul><font 
color=#293932>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foul/Penalties:</font></a></dt><br><br><dd>
