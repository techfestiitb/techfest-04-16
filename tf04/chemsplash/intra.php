RULES</b></font></strong></a> </p>
<ol> 

<li>Each lift will be given one opportunity per round to rise to a specified height carrying different loads. The height
to be achieved by the lift is 2ft±0.5ft for the performance competition.<br><br></li>

 
<li>The lift will start with its pan just touching a designated starting point. There will be a vertical scale which has
to be attached to the setup. The height that the lift rises to would be observed on this scale. The distance will be
measured with respect to the top most the pan.<br><br></li>


<li>A lift that goes outside the bounds (i.e. more/less than 6 inches of the specified height) will have its load lifted calculated as:<br>
 <img src="chemsplash/clip.gif" alt="formula"/><br><br></li>
  
<li>An objective of this contest is the demonstration of the ability to control a chemical reaction. The only energy
source for the propulsion of the lift is a chemical reaction. Commercial batteries (for example, AA batteries),
Commercial engines (combustion engines) are not allowed as the power source.<br><br> </li><li>The lift must be an
autonomous vehicle and cannot be controlled remotely.<b> Pushing to start the lift or a mechanical starting device is
not allowed.</b> There can be no electronic timing device(s) to stop the chemical reaction.
<br><br></li>

<li>The lift must carry a pan that holds the weights. At the competition, only the weights will be supplied, thus each
lift must already have its own pan. The size o the pan should at least be 15cms x 15 cms. Weight of the pan will not be
considered at the time of calculation of maximum weight lifted by the lift.<br><br></li>

<li>Students are responsible for transportation of the chemicals to the competition site. Students are also responsible
for arranging for the disposal of their chemicals and wastes. The possibility of on-site waste disposal will be posted
here, if available.<br><br></li>

sounding boards to the student queries. The faculty cannot be idea generators for the project.<br><br></li>

on
all.</li><br></ol> <br><br>

CRITERIA:</b></a></strong></font></p><blockquote>The team which lifts the 
maximum amount of load in three rounds, to the
above said height would be declared as the winner. Ties will be decided by considering the second/third best weight
lifted by the two teams.</blockquote>
<p><b><a name=safenorms><font color="#293932">SAFETY NORMS:</a></font></b></p> <ol> <li>Safety and safe transportation
procedures are important items to address. 
Each team must have a MSDS for each chemical it is using. If obvious safety violations have occurred, the judges have
the discretion to disqualify the entry.<br><br></li>

<li>If a lift is deemed unsafe, then the judges may disqualify it. Given the general public's lack of understanding of
general chemistry, anything that is visibly left behind, may well be construed as chemical pollution, and even
hazardous. Any entry using or producing a corrosive chemical(s) must have the chemical(s) sealed in a container, or at
least use a spill-proof container.<br><br></li>

<li>Appropriate personal protection must be worn by the team members operating the lift. All lifts must safely operate
inside a building.</li><br> <li>Chemicals <b>must not</b> be stored in hostel rooms. Check here for the latest
information on where chemicals may be stored at the competition site: <a href=main.php?file=chemsplash/chemsplash.php
class=greylink>www.techfest.org/chemsplash</a>.<br><br></li><li> In order to facilitate chemical safety at the
competition site, a designated area will be identified where teams must mix or prepare their chemicals (unless the
materials are pre-mixed). Unfortunately, due to hostel safety regulations it is not possible to allow teams to do "trial
runs" in the hostels. Teams that violate these safety rules jeopardize the continued operation of High Spirits
Competition and will be disqualified.<br><br></li>
