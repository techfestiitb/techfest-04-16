<br> <p><strong><a name=some><font color=#293932><b>SOME GUIDELINES:</b></font></strong></a> </p> 
<ol>
<li>Choose a base for the reactor which can run smoothly on the given platform with reactor on it, base can be a toy car or it can made by fixing four wheels on the hardboard.</li><br><br>
<li>The material for reactor can be PVC pipes (used for toilet fittings etc), as PVC is inert to almost all chemicals.</li><br><br>
<li>After making the reactor check for its leakage by filling water in it and if there is some leakage, it can be removed by using wax, m-seal and other glues.</li><br><br>
<li>If you are making propulsion type reactor, you can use whistle of the pressure cooker as the nozzle of your reactor ( we also used whistle as our nozzle), several other nozzles are icing nozzle etc.</li><br><br>
<li>Always use chemicals in the optimum quantity because your reactor may explode because of high pressure ( our reactor exploded twice before the test run).</li><br><br>
<li>Use chemicals safely!!!!!</li></ol>
<br><br><p><strong><a name=driving><font color=#293932><b>DRIVING MECHANISMS:</b></font></strong></a> </p>
<p>Of all mechanisms available, <b>Propulsion</b> would be the first thought to come to mind.</p> 
<ol>
<li>A couple of reactions which are suitable:</li><br><br>
<ol type=disc>
<li>2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + MnO<sub>2</sub> --->    O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + MnO<sub>2</sub></li><br><br>
<li>2Al(s) + 2NaOH(aq) + 6H<sub>2</sub>O(l) --->  2NaAl(OH)<sub>4</sub> (aq) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g)</li><br><br></ol>
<li>These are <b>not</b> the only reactions available. Other reactions which are capable of producing a high amount of gas in a very short time are also recommended. For eg.- Vinegar added to baking soda gives great results.</li><br><br>
<li>The propulsion will basically take place through a one way valve which allows the gas to escape only after sufficient pressure has been built up. This will propel the car with the desired velocity.</li><br><br>
<li>The problem one faces with propulsion is the control of the      
reaction. Thus, to get the car to stop in the desired distance would require some ingenuity/practice.</li><br>
</ol><br>

Another option is the use of <b>Lead acid batteries</b> connected to a motor.<br><br>
<ol>
<li>The raw materials for these are readily available and it is simple to construct. The great advantage with these is the power output you get. However, these can be bulky and that needs to be taken care of. For details about lead batteries, visit the following sites:</li><br><br>
<ul type=disc>
<li><a class=greylink href=http://www.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/chem2/Batteries.html target=_blanl>http://www.ucdsb.on.ca/tiss/stretton/chem2/Batteries.html</a></li><br><br>
<li><a class=greylink href=http://www.uaf.edu/energyin/webpage/pages/energy_storage/batteries.htm target=_blank>http://www.uaf.edu/energyin/webpage/pages/energy_storage/batteries.htm</a></li><br><br>
<li><a class=greylink href=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/leadacid.html target=_blank>http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/leadacid.html</a></li><br><br>
<li><a class=greylink href=http://www.chem.uidaho.edu/~honors/pbacid.html target=_blank>http://www.chem.uidaho.edu/~honors/pbacid.html</a></li><br><br>
</ul>
<li>The plates required for the batteries are easily available in shops that sell commercial lead acid batteries (like Exide).</li><br>
</ol>
<br>

Another good option is <b>Electrochemical Cells.</b>
<ol>
<li>Two types of such cells which are both easy to make and and also for which the raw materials are easily available are the <b>Daniel cell</b> and the <b>Leclanche cell.</b></li><br><br>
<li>The problem with these is their amperage. There is high internal resistance in these. So if you can solve this problem, choose this option. In fact there have been teams who have actually used these reactions with great accuracy.</li><br><br>
<li>A very good alternative, not very far from the one considered is the use of a<b> Dry cell</b>. Almost all the problems encountered above are gotten rid off in a dry cell. They hardly consume any space or produce a significant weight. For details about dry cells, visit the following sites: </li><br><br>
<ul type=disc>
<li><a class=greylink href=http://library.kcc.hawaii.edu/external/chemistry/everyday_battery.html target=_blank>http://library.kcc.hawaii.edu/external/chemistry/everyday_battery.html</a></li><br><br>
<li><a class=greylink href=http://www.energizer.com/learning/howbatterieswork.asp target=_blanl>http://www.energizer.com/learning/howbatterieswork.asp</a></li><br><br>
<li><a class=greylink href=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/electrochem.html target=_blank>http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/electrochem.html</a></li><br><br></ul>
<li>The zinc container for the cell can easily be made out of a           zinc plate which is readily available. Alternatively you can use the zinc cases of commercial dry cells. Also, the same carbon rod can be used.</li><br><br>

<li>Great care must be taken to taken to ensure that the electrolyte mixture has really low moisture content and is compacted to a great extent. Of course, some moisture is necessary for the reaction. So, optimization must me done.</li><br><br>
<li>MnO<sub>2</sub> concentration must be very high near the carbon rod.</li><br><br>

<li>A tissue paper can be used to form the salt bridge.</li><br><br>

<li>Dry cells have the advantage of good amperage, good life, low cost and low weight and volume.</li>
</ol>
<br><br><p><strong><a name=stopping><font color=#293932><b>STOPPING MECHANISMS:</b></font></strong></a> </p>
Once you have constructed your driving mechanism, you have to use some mechanism to stop the car at the desired distance.<br><br>
<ul type=disc>
<li>If you are using propulsion, you can use measured amounts of chemicals which will generate the appropriate amount of gas needed to propel the car to the specified distance.</li><br><br>
<li>If you are using electrochemical cells, you will get a constant velocity. A circuit breaking mechanism can be used which will break the driving circuit at the desired distance. For eg.- a children.s sparkler can be used as a timing device to break the circuit at the desired point by connecting it to a fusible circuit link.</li><br><br></ul>

There are many more driving and stopping mechanisms you can think of. These were just to get you started!<br><br>
