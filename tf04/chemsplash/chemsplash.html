<h3>CHEMSPLASH</h3></b>
<a name=back></a>

<span><font color=#293932><b>The Chemical Engineering 
Extravaganza</b></font></span><br><br>

<p>Chemsplash is THE annual event for chem enthusiasts. From what started of as a mere idea in the year 2000 has
blossomed into an event which is now the biggest event of its kind in India.It now boasts of participation of 200 teams
from all over the country, battling over competitions like Chem-e-car, Turbulence
(The quiz contest) and TechnumOpus (The poster presentation contest) for prizes worth 50 grand. This year, we have introduced a new event called High Spirits which is bound to stimulate your grey cells!
<br>
<br>
A brief description of the events we have in Chemplash 2004 :

<a class=grey1link href=laporsche.html><b>la porsChe:</b>
</a><img src="../competitions/chem-car.jpg" hspace=20 vspace=20 align="right">
<p> <blockquote>The objective of this highly successful competition is to 
design and
construct a car that is powered with a chemical energy source that will
carry a load to a given distance and stop by exhausting the power source
or cutting of the power without the application of brakes or electronic
mechanism (so here you need to trust those whimsical chemicals!!!) The car to stand such a scare should be robust and yet pleasing to the eyes! 
To know how we decide on such an ultimate car, check out the <a class=greylink 
href=laporsche.html>rules</a>.

<a class=grey1link href=highspirits.html><b>High Spirits:</b></a>
<p> <blockquote>

Ever wondered how that lift manages to take you to the 80<sup>th</sup> floor of the
Empire State Building? That one's easy...just electricity. At TechFest, however, everything
works differently, doesn't it?

You will have to design a lift that will raise a load through a specified height. The catch
is, it has to be powered purely by chemicals.

<a href=technum.html class=grey1link><b>TechnumOpus:</b></a><blockquote>
<p> This is the poster presentation contest at Chemsplash. 
Here you get an opportunity to present a paper on any topic related to
the world of chemistry / chemical engineering. Entries will be short listed
based upon an abstract which all the teams have to send a month before
Techfest commences.

<a  class=grey1link 
href=dexterden.html><b>Dexter's Den:</b></a>
<p><blockquote>
Einstein was once asked 'Assume that the world is going to end an hour, 
how would you react' The great soul was quick to reply, 'I'd 
mathematically model the problem in the first fifty-nine minutes so as to 
get a one minute solution to the problem'. Though we do not know the 
degree of truth in this anecdote we can surely offer you a chance to play 
Einstein, albeit a chemical engineering one. Chemsplash is proud to 
unravel for the first time Dexter's Den.

<a class=grey1link  href=turbulence.html><b>Turbulence:</b></a></font>

<p><blockquote>
This is the quiz competition at ChemSplash. It consists of a written eliminations round, followed by the finals, which will consist
of several interesting rounds like visual round, buzzer round, the normal
questions round and rapid fire at the end.

What is the driving force behind Chemsplash?</b>
<br><br>
Chemical Engineering is a creation of the 20th Century. We have had a 
century in which Chemical engineering has blossomed, developed, 
transformed itself, and perhaps matured. 
We are now in a new century, Chemical Engineering's second century, and 
already challenges are driving vast changes in our industries, their 
methods of operation, their requirements of Chemical Engineers-indeed, 
society's requirements of Chemical Engineers-and the educational 
approaches and tools we can and need to use.
The chemical process Industry has been the engine behind the growth of 
wealth of nations. The global chemical industry is transforming itself by 
placing at its centre the concerns for human safety and welfare, 
environmental protection, energy conservation and higher efficiency. And 
in this endeavor of reinventing itself the chemical industry is rapidly 
imbibing the benefits of the ongoing Information Technology revolution. In 
short, our profession is in a state of heady flux! 
And thus, our times can at once appear confusing as well as stupendously 
potent! So, what are the dominant evolutionary strands today in the 
chemical engineering profession? We need to reflect and sift the true from 
the apparent. This real world practice of our profession is made in the 
events of Chemsplash, which itself is a true handmaiden of progress.
