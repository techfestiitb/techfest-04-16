A.D. Earth. After the 4<sup>th</sup> world war, 
the world has completely 
  changed. The petroleum based fuels had already been drained in the 3rd world 
  war. The dust holocaust has cut off the sun. All eyes have turned to alternative 
  fuels. Chemicals have been identified as the potential energy source and our 
  aim is to develop a car which can survive the scare. Introducing '<strong>la 
  porsChe</strong>'!!!<br>
  <br>
  There would be two portions to la porsChe Competition:<br>
  a <strong>poster competition</strong> and a <strong>car performance competition</strong>.

  <a name=poster><font color=#1f3d55><b>POSTER 
COMPETITION:</b></font></a><br>
  <br>
<ol>
  <li>A poster board must be displayed with the autonomous vehicle on the day 
    of the competition. This poster should describe how the car is powered using 
    the chemical reaction, the unique features of the car, and environmental and 
    safety features in the design. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be 
    present for each chemical used by the entry. Safety and safe transportation 
    procedures are important items to address. If obvious safety violations have 
    occurred, the judges have the discretion to disqualify the entry. Entries 
    will also be judged on creativity in the propulsion system and the appearance 
    of the vehicle. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The poster competition and judging will occur prior to the car performance 
    competition. Team members should be present during judging to answer questions 
    from the judges.<br><br></li><li>Winners of the poster competition will be announced at the end of the car performance competition.<br><br></li>
	<li>Posters will be judged according to the following criteria, with a maximum of 20 possible points (equal weighting):<br>
	<ul type="disc"><li>Description of the chemical reaction/power source.</li><li>Unique features of the vehicle.</li><li>Design creativity.</li><li>Environmental and safety features.</li><li>Quality of the poster and team member presentations.</li></ul></li>
</ol><br><br>
<a name=car><font color=#1f3d55><b>CAR PEROFORAMNCE 
COMPETITION:</b></font></a><br><br>
<ol>
  <li>Each car will be given two opportunities to traverse a specified distance 
    carrying a certain fixed additional load. The required distance will be given 
    to each team one hour prior to the start of the performance competition. The 
    distance will be between 15 and 30 ft ± 0.5 in. and the load will be 200 ml 
    of water. A judge will measure out the prescribed water for each team. Teams 
    may not add or remove any "load" (or other inert items) to adjust their vehicle 
    weight once the poster session has concluded. Teams are allowed to adjust 
    "fuel" or reactants used in the car's chemical reaction.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The car will start with its front end just touching the designated starting 
    line. There will be a designated finish line. The distance will be measured 
    with respect to the front most point of the car. The goal of the competition 
    is to have your car stop closest to the specified finish line (in bounds) 
    while carrying the specified load. The course will be rectangular shaped with 
    a starting line and the prescribed distance clearly marked. Physical site 
    will dictate the exact course layout. A vehicle that goes outside the course 
    will have its distance measured to where it went out of bounds and will receive 
    a penalty of 5ft. added to the measured distance. When measuring the distance 
    from the finish line it does not matter if the car goes longer or shorter 
    than the prescribed distance. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A judge will announce each team just prior to the start of their run. The 
    team then has 1 minute to get to the starting line. Each team will be asked 
    to introduce their entry to the audience (College name and briefly mention 
    your propulsion system). Each car will have 2 attempts to complete the course, 
    each attempt lasting no more than 2 minutes. The best score of these two attempts 
    will be used in the judging. The next team to compete should be ready and 
    at the staging area at least 5 minutes before their anticipated run time. 
    In the event a team fails to show up on the start line, or the vehicle fails 
    to start, the next team on the competition order list will be announced and 
    requested to proceed to the starting line. In the first round of competition 
    the order of the teams will be by random drawing. At the completion of the 
    first round there will be a short break before the second round begins. The 
    competition order in the second round will be determined by the 1st round 
    standings, beginning with the team that is farthest from the prescribed distance 
    and ending with the team that was closest. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ties will be decided by the best average from the two runs completed.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>An objective of this contest is the demonstration of the ability to control 
    a chemical reaction. The only energy source for the propulsion of the car 
    is a chemical reaction. Commercial batteries (for example, AA batteries) are 
    not allowed as the power source. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The car must be an autonomous vehicle and cannot be controlled remotely. 
    Pushing to start the vehicle or a mechanical starting device is not allowed. 
    Check with the Rules Coordinators if you have a specific question concerning 
    your vehicle.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>No mechanical force can be applied to the wheel or ground to slow or stop 
    the car (e.g. no brakes).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>There can be no mechanical or electronic timing device(s) to stop the chemical 
    reaction.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>All components of the car must fit into a shoebox of dimensions no larger 
    than 40 cm x 30 cm x 18 cm. The car may be disassembled to meet this requirement. 
    If the judges are uncertain whether the car will fit inside the box when dissembled, 
    they may request that the team demonstrate that they can do this.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The car must carry a container that holds up to 200 ml of water without 
    spilling. At the competition, only the water will be supplied, thus each car 
    must already have its own container.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The cost of the contents of the "shoe box" and the chemicals must not exceed 
    Rs 750.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Students are responsible for transportation of the chemicals to the competition 
    sites. Students are also responsible for arranging for the disposal of their 
    chemicals and wastes. The possibility of on-site waste disposal will be posted 
    here, if available. Hazardous chemical protocols must be followed and reported 
    on the poster. Each team must have a MSDS for each chemical it is using. If 
    obvious safety violations have occurred, the judges have the discretion to 
    disqualify the entry.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Appropriate personal protection must be worn by those team members operating 
    the vehicle. All cars must safely operate inside a building. If a car is deemed 
    unsafe, then the judges may disqualify it. Given the general public's lack 
    of understanding of general chemistry, anything that is visibly left behind 
    may well be construed as chemical pollution, and even hazardous. Any entry 
    using or producing a corrosive chemical(s) must have the chemical(s) sealed 
    in a container, or at least use a spill-proof container. If there is any uncertainty 
    on an issue of safety or other judging criteria, please contact:<br>

  <li>Chemicals must not be stored in hostel rooms. In order to facilitate chemical 
    safety at the competition site, a designated area will be identified where 
    teams must mix or prepare their chemicals (unless the material are pre-mixed). 
    All chemicals will be made available to the teams in the chemical preparation 
    area at least 2 hours prior to the performance competition. Unfortunately, 
    due to hostel safety regulations it is not possible to allow teams to do "trial 
    runs" in the hostels. Teams that violate these safety rules jeopardize the 
    continued operation of la porsChe Competition and may be disqualified by the 
    judges.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The competition will be conducted on the honor system. Faculty and graduate 
    students can only act as sounding boards to the student queries. The faculty 
    cannot be idea generators for the project.<br>
    <br> </li>
  <li>The maximum team size is four participants. All team members do not have 
    to be present at the competition; however, all are encouraged to try and attend.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Four new categories have been created. The award criteria will be as follows:<br>
    <strong> Most Consistent Performance</strong>This award is based on the best 
    average score for the two runs that the vehicle makes. It has been created 
    to recognize the team that has designed and most understands the performance 
    of the reaction that powers the vehicle.<br>
    <strong>Spirit of the Competition </strong>- This award is given to the team displaying the 
    most team spirit as decided by a panel of judges.<br>
    <strong>Most Creative Drive System</strong> - Recognition is awarded to the team that has designed 
    and installed the most creative propulsion system. The winner is decided by 
    a panel of judges during the poster competition. <br>
   <strong> Most creative vehicle design</strong>- The winning entry is decided by a ballot cast 
    by people watching the competition.<br>
