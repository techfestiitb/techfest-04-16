 <p>Einstein was once asked
'Assume that the world is going to end in an hour, how would you react' The
great soul was quick to reply, 'I'd mathematically model the problem in
the first fifty-nine minutes so as to
  get a one minute solution to the problem'. Though we do not know the
  degree of truth in this anecdote we can surely offer you a chance to play
  Einstein, albeit a chemical engineering one. Chemsplash is proud to
  unravel for the first time <strong>Dexter's Den</strong>. The event will comprise of two stages:<br><br>Total Cash Prize of Rs. <b>10,000</b> to be won.</p>
<font color=#293932><b>Stage 1: Mathmodel</b></font><br><br>
<ol type=i><li>  The participants will be provided with three problem 
statements at the start 
  of the day of the event. Participants will be required to mathematically/qualitatively 
  model a solution to one of the problems. The solutions will be expected by the 
  end of the day.</li><li>
This will only be an elimination round and no points from this 
  stage would carry over to the next.</li><li>


Based on the mathematical model that the teams have proposed five
teams will be selected for the next round. The judge's decision in 
this regard will be final and binding.</li><li>

In case the team has provided more than one solution, the best
solution will be considered for stage 2.</li></ol><br>
<font color=#293932><b>Stage 2: Implementing the 
model</b></font><br><br><ol type=i><li>	
The teams will have to implement   their model in this stage of the competition. The necessary apparatus, materials 
  and chemicals for this purpose will be provided.</li><li> The exact 
details of these   will have been made
  clear in the first stage and the teams would be expected to base their solution 
  utilizing these and no more materials. Violation of this rule in would lead 
  to disqualification of the team. The best solution for each problem will be 
  declared the winner.</li></ol><br>
<p><font color=#293932><b>General Rules:</b></font></p>
<ol><li>Teams for this event could consist of one or two members.<br><br></li><li>
For this event, no pre-registrations are required. Participants will have to register on the spot.
<br><br></li><li>
Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.<br><br></li></ol><br>
