Rope-Climbing Machine Design Contest at Techfest 2004</strong></font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Techfest is the annual science and technology festival of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, India. Techfest 
2004 is scheduled for 24th-26th January 2004 at Mumbai, India and promises a myriad of events like Competitions, 
Workshops, Lecture Series and entertainment shows. With its inception in 1998 to being the largest of it's kind in 
entire Asia in 2003, Techfest has come a long way. In its seventh avatar, Techfest 2004 extends its horizons to reach 
out to students not only from India but across the world. We introduce <b>Cliffhanger</b> - the rope-climbing machine 
design contest!

<br><br>

To scale heights has always been a challenge for the mankind … be it the chilly heights of Mt. Everest or simply a few 
storeys of a building on fire! And every such situation urges mankind to look for newer options to tame the challenge. Machines have come long way in doing what was once thought to be impossible. Yet again, we look for machines that can scale heights and find application in day to day problems like fire-fighting, disaster management and rescue operations. Cliffhanger presents a simplified situation that addresses this issue as the problem statement of the contest.  
<br><br>

Entries for Cliffhanger are invited from any school 
student or undergraduate/postgraduate student from across the world. The 
participants would be
classified into 2 categories - <i> India</i> and<i> Rest of the World </i>- for the qualifying round. The teams
clearing this qualifying round shall attend the finals to be held in Mumbai, India during Techfest 2004 (24th- 26th
January, 2004). A few select qualifying teams from the Rest of the World category will also receive to and fro airfare
for the finals. The winning teams from both the categories combined would receive cash prizes of a total of US $ 2500.
Please see the links below for complete details of the contest.

<p><strong><a name=prob><font color=#293932 ><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></font></a></strong>
<blockquote> 
  <p>A rectangular plateau (2m x 1.5m) rests on a cliff 1.5m high. This plateau is divided into 2 regions by a boundary 
at the centre and has 10 balloons placed in each region (see figure below). Make a machine that climbs up the 1.5m high 
cliff with the help of freely hanging rope (see specifications) and bursts the balloons placed on the plateau. 
Two competing machines start on the task simultaneously and the one that bursts all balloons in the minimum time or maximum number of balloons in the allotted 5 minutes, which ever happens earlier, will be declared winner. In case, none of the machines competing are able to complete the task, the machine ahead in the game will be declared winner.
</p>

    <br><blockquote>
  The plateau (2m x 1.5m) rests on a cliff (of height 1.5m) made up of plywood. The plateau is surrounded by a 
transparent acrylic sheet of height 12.5 cm having an opening of length 40cm on both sides for the machines to enter. It is divided into two equal open-top compartments by acrylic sheet.

      as far as the structure will allow.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li> The competitor will be allowed to engage the rope to his/her machine 
      at the beginning of the game. You are not allowed to touch your machine 
      once the game starts.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>The machine should climb up using only the rope and the support of the 
      wall.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> After reaching the top, the machine should completely disengage itself 
      from the rope before it starts bursting the balloons.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li> Ten balloons will be randomly placed inside each compartment. The machine 
      which bursts more number of balloons wins.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
