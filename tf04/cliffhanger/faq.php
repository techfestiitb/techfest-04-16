<ul><li><b>Does the machine have to be autonomous or can it be controlled via a remote?</b><br>The machine need not be autonomous. It can be controlled via wires or remote but take care that all the wires coming out of the machine should be slack through out the game.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>
What will be the initial position of the machine?</b><br>Initially, the machine could take support of the wall but it should not apply any force on it and the machine should touch the ground.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>When will the game start?</b><br>The game starts as soon as both machines engage their respective ropes (manually) to their machines. Once the game starts, any type of interference by the participants is not allowed.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>How can I engage rope with the machine?</b><br>You can engage the rope to your machine at the beginning of the game manually but you are not allowed to touch your machine once the game starts.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>
Can I wind the rope with the machine at the start of the game?</b><br>
No, you cannot wind the rope to your machine at the start of the
game and after reaching the top, the  machine should be disengaged
completely from the rope before it starts bursting the balloons.</ul></li>
<ul><li><b> What are the specifications of the rope?</b><br>Rope is standard all over the world and it is generally used for mountaineering purpose. Dimensions are already given in the problem statement.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>How exactly will the rope be attached to the plateau? Nailed, knot stuck in a hole etc.</b><br>The rope shall be attached only to the top of the plateau at a distance of  10 cms from the edge by a knot stuck in a hole on the top of the plateau.It will not be fixed any where else on the game board and hang freely from the top.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Will the rope hang till the ground level or will it be 
higher/lower?</b><br>The rope will be of long enough to just touch the ground.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b> Is 220 V allowed onboard?</b><br>Yes, it is allowed but not compulsory that you have power supply on your machine itself. We will provide 220V external power supply.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>What is the brand of balloons and the specification you plan to use?</b><br>The balloons will be the common ones available in any general store. The brand is not fixed. The average size is mentioned in the problem statement website under the heading "Description of Balloon". </li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Does the game get over after bursting the balloon or does the machine has to climb down?</b><br>The game gets over as soon as you burst all the balloons or after 5 minutes, whichever happens first. The machine does not have to climb down. </li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Can  I build two separate modules for the challenge i.e. can one robot climb the rope and then deliver its payload which is the balloon bursting robot?</b><br>The machine cannot leave its parts on the platform. Hence, your two robots cannot be entirely separate from each other. Also, the entire robot built by you must be contained in a (10 x 10 x 10) inch box at every point of the game.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Will switch box or wires from where we operate the machine be included in the size of machine?</b><br>No, wires and switch boxes are excluded while checking the size of the machine. </li></ul>
