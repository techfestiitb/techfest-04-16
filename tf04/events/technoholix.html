<p>Glamorous to the hilt, visual razzmatazz, audacity in its 
utmost limits, 
that is what Technoholix is all about. Take a break from the 
tiring
competition of day and relax your cells. Pure entertainment and
enthrallment awaits you in some core cutting-edge technology, 
spectacular
shows and soccer playing robots.
<br><br>
Previous Techfests saw a spectrum of such events. A brilliant display of
3D Laser enchanting you to the core left the Open Air Theater packed with
capacity of 5000 in a trance. The German AIBO Team from Dortmund
University came over with Sony's soccer playing robots in style - warm-up,
match, victory dance ... all in full automation.  And that's not all.
Mercedes Benz SL 500 was on display for the first time in India after its
official launch at Auto Expo earlier in January.  This year, we promise
nothing less, if not better. You will have to be there to experience the 
addiction.</p>
<p><strong><font color=#293932>Scitech Olympiad:</font></strong><br><br>
It is bigger than you can imagine! Six finalists from amongst 200 teams
will make it to the finals of the SciTech, to be held in the OAT in 
front of  an audience of 4000. And if you thought quizzing was all about 
obvious,
 watch the nerve-cracking grand finale as each team fights it out for the
Rs. 27,000 cash prize. This year, renowned quiz master Barry O'Brien would
do the honours of hosting the quiz.
</p>
<p><strong><a class=grey1link 
href=competitions/dirtracing.html>Dirt 
Track:</a></strong><br><br>
It's all about speed, control and some adrenalin. Watch the wizards of
Dirt Track Racing fight it out for the top slot with their high and mighty
RC machines (remote-controlled) against the heavy odds of the track.
Treacherous track, mean machines and live action. Its all happening in
the Dirt Track at Technoholix.
</p>
<p><strong><font color=#293932>Walkthrough:</font></strong><br><br>
Life is a strange journey. Some, at the end of it, are lost in the sands
of time, while others leave their names on the milestones. In the
Walk-through, we try to relive this journey. Have a glimpse of how things
evolved, how events shaped up and how testimonies were written ... all in
a captivating and fascinating style.
</p>
<br>All in all, an experience that will leave you wanting for more! 
Addicted,
you will be.
