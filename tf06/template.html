					<p>Hello there,</p>
					<p>Techfest, Asia's largest science and technology festival, is back with its ninth edition, Techfest '06, to be held from the 20th – 22nd January, 2006.A prominent feature of Techfest has been its dynamism and innovativeness. Techfest '06 has taken a giant step by departing from its previously established events and competitions to come up with six "themes" which focus on hot and happening technologies in various fields. </p>
					<p>There are lots of happening events and competitions lined up for you at Techfest '06 including Hover Junior, under Sixth Gear, which is a competition just for school students (up to 10+2) </p>
					<p>Read on for more information on the different themes and the events under each theme.</p>

				<div style="background-color:#F2F6F7; color:#000000; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;">
					<p>The name says it all. Artificial Intelligence - The buzzword of the future. We present you with the opportunity to create and code machines of tomorrow that obey orders, learn through experience and try to emulate humans as closely as possible. Through a series of lectures, workshops and competitions, we shall give you a glimpse of things to come, things that are at the heart of Artificial Intelligence! </p>

				<div style="background-color:#F2F6F7; color:#000000; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;">
					<p>In this prestigious event, teams must build an autonomous machine that can navigate a maze and reach the destination in the fastest time possible. The mouse must be entirely self-contained and autonomous. Use of computers for controlling the machine is not allowed. Also no information regarding the maze can be fed to the mouse once the maze is revealed. Last date for registration of entries is 10th December 2005. Techfest ’05 saw the maze conquered in a blistering 17 seconds – an Indian record. Do you have it in you to better this time and be the Master of the Maze??? </p>

				<div style="background-color:#F2F6F7; color:#000000; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;">
					<p>Participants must code a program which can identify mouse-drawn/stylus-written on-screen characters. The input characters will be in the Devanagari script and the output must be displayed on screen in a console in UNICODE format. The use of MATLAB/MATHEMATICA/SCILAB or any environment similar to these is strictly prohibited but teams can use programming languages like C/C++/VB/Fortran etc. As a screening procedure, all teams have to submit an abstract regarding the algorithm and flowchart of the code. Selected entries will be called to IIT Bombay where the competition will be held in two stages. In the first stage, teams will be asked to identify characters and in the second stage, they have to make a presentation to the judges about their code, algorithm etc. </p>
					<p>Last date for registration as well as abstract submission is 10th December, 2005. </p>

				<div style="background-color:#F2F6F7; color:#000000; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px;">
					<p>Techfest ’06 presents the battle of programs – Core War. Build a program whose objective is to terminate (kill) all processes of the opposing program leaving your program in charge of the machine. The programs must be written in the assembly language Redcode and will be run on a virtual computer called MARS. The hill (environment) is the battlefield for the programs where they will combat with other warriors (programs). A challenging warrior makes it to the hill by displacing a warrior on the hill with a lower score than the challenger. In a series of battles, only one warrior will emerge victorious and stay on the hill to be crowned the ‘King of the Hill’. Remember, only the fittest shall survive. </p>

					<p>A similar exhibition will be held at Techfest this year. India is only the second country outside the US where this exhibition is being held!!! ASU will be sending a team of 4-5 NASA researchers to guide us through the exhibition. Some highlights of what can be expected: </p>
					<p>i) Display of scaled-down models of the space-craft, the rovers and probes on Mars, and full-sized models of the instruments fitted onto the probes and space-craft. Also on display will be fist-sized meteorites collected by ASU over the years. </p>
					<p>ii) Latest videos, fresh from the rovers on Mars, to be beamed down at this exhibition!!!</p>
					<p>iii) Video-clippings of the highlights of the mission, right from launch of the space-craft to touchdown on Mars, from panoramic views captured by the rovers on Mars to flight-views of the canyons of Mars!!! And lots more!! </p>

					<p>Every year at Techfest we see a number of brilliant ideas surfacing in different competitions. Some of them win prizes while some others go largely unnoticed but a vast majority of ideas never go beyond the competition level and gradually fade away into oblivion. </p>
					<p>To catch brilliant and innovative ideas and tap their potential, Techfest ’06 in association with CHIP launches the Technovision awards for innovations in pure sciences and engineering. Become a ‘technovisionary’ at Asia’s largest science and technological festival, get international recognition and take home a number of prizes. Do you have it in you?? </p>
					<p>Teams must first submit an abstract detailing the main points of their idea. Selected teams will be called to make a presentation of their idea before a panel of judges at Techfest ’06. Participation in Prayaas and Innovision will give teams a direct entry into Innovision and no separate abstracts have to be submitted by these teams.</p>
					<p>Last date for registration and abstract submission is December 20th, 2005.</p>
