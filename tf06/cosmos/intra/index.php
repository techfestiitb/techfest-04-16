<h1>The Game Arena</h1>
<p>There are two metal pipes each 120 cm long at a height of 50 cm from the ground and separated by a distance of 40 cm. The pipes are made of standard GI pipes of nominal diameter 0.75 inch and external diameter 26.5 ± 1 mm, coated with oil paint. Initially the cylinder can be placed anywhere in the ZONE A manually. The cylinder then has to be picked up by the machine and carried to the other end of the pipes and placed in one of the three zones (ZONES 1,2,3). Points will be awarded for various stages of the game.</p>

<h1>Machine Specifications</h1>
<p><ul><li>The machine should fit within a box of dimensions (25*25*25) cm at the start of the game. The external device which is used to control the machine manually is not included in the size constraint.</li>
 <li>The machine must use power converted from a source of electrical energy. Mechanical force/power should not be transferred to the machine from outside. Chemicals, compressed gas and rockets, fuels, combustion power methods, etc. are strictly prohibited. However commercial batteries like dry cells and lead acid cells are permitted.</li>
<li>The machine may or may not have an onboard source of power. External source of electrical power is permitted. </li>
</ul></p>
<a name="grules"></a>
<h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
<p><ul>
<li>The teams are allowed to manually engage the machine to the pipes at the start of the game.</li>
<li>There is no restriction on the size of the machine after the machine has been checked for dimensions.</li>
<li>The rear part of the machine should touch Region A at the start of the game. The machine has to transverse through the pipes to reach the Zone A.</li>
<li>The machine has to then pick up a cylindrical object which can be initially placed anywhere in the Zone A by the team. </li>
<li>The machine can use any mechanism whatsoever to pick up the object. However chemicals, compressed gas and rockets, fuels, combustion power methods are strictly prohibited. </li>
<li>The machine has to then move backwards carrying the cylinder and place it in one of the zones provided.</li>
<li>No part of the cylinder must touch the ground while the machine is moving to the other end.</li>
<li>While placing the cylinder in the zones provided no part of the machine should be in contact with the Region B or the Region A.</li>
<li>The cylinder once in stable contact with the ground will be considered as the final drop position; no further change in the drop position of the cylinder will be entertained.</li>
<li>In case the machine drops the cylinder before entering the zonal region the cylinder can be placed again at the initial position but with certain penalty of points(refer to points structure). </li>
<li>After the machine places the cylinder in the zone, another identical cylinder will be placed in the ZONE A by one of the team members. The machine has to now come back to Region B pick up the cylinder and follow the same procedure as before.  </li>
<li>While the machine is in the process of picking up the new identical cylinder, the previously placed cylinder will be removed from the zonal region.</li>
<li>The machine can lift only one cylinder at a time.</li>
<li>In case the machine falls off the rails during any point of the game, it can be manually engaged to the initial position but with certain penalty of points (refer to points structure). </li>
<li>The clock will not be stopped at any instant of the game.</li>
<li>The time limit for each team is 5 minutes .At the end of 5 minutes the machine which has most number of points, after taking into account the penalties is declared as the winner. But in case of equal points there with be rematch(es).</li>
<li> The machine should NOT be made using Lego parts, assemblies from toys etc. However, the remote control systems from toys can be used. Also, standard kits like the Basic Stamp kits may be used. Please note that readymade wheels and gearboxes may be used.</li>
</ul></p>
<a name="point"></a>
<h1>Points Structure</h1>
<p><strong>Traversing from one end to the other +50 points.</strong> There will be no points for traversing from Region B to Region A without the cylinder. The points for traversing from Region A to and B will be given only if the machine has placed the cylinder in one of the zones in the prior round (except the first run).</p>
<p><strong>Picking up a cylinder +100 points.</strong> Picking up means no part of the cylinder must be in contact with the ground. The points will be given only once for each round.</p>
<strong>Points for placing the cylinders</strong>
<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="10">
<tr><td align="center">Zone 1</td><td align="center">Zone 2</td><td align="center">Zone 3</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">200</td><td align="center">150</td><td align="center">100</td></tr>
</table>
<p>For gaining points for a particular zone the cylinder must be completely placed within the zone. If any part of the cylinder even touches the boundary line, points awarded will be that corresponding to the next zone.</p>
<p>In case of any ambiguity regarding the point structure the Judges’ discretion will be used</p>
<h3>Penalty</h3>
<p>50 points will be deducted if </p>
1. Machine falls off the track<br>
2. The machine is unable to move and the team wishes to restart.<br>
<p>In each case the machine will be put to the starting position and the clock will never be stopped.</p>
<p>If the cylinder comes in contact with the ground while the machine is traversing from one region to the other the cylinder will be placed in the ZONE A and the machine will have to go back and lift the cylinder again. 50 points will also be deducted. </p>
<p>However if the cylinder touches the ground in ZONE A there is no penalty, but the cylinder will again be placed in ZONE A. The clock will never be stopped in any condition. </p>
<p>In case the cylinder falls down in the zonal region (Zone 1, 2, 3), there is no penalty and the points will be given only if it becomes stationary in one of the zones. </p>

<h1>General Rules</h1>
<h3>Power Supply</h3>
<p>Normal 220 ± 2% volt 50 Hz AC extension boards will be available at the venue. You should fetch your own eliminators/adaptors. No specialized demand should be made. Use of heavy equipment like compressors is banned. The power cords connecting a machine to the power supply must be slack at all times. Likewise the Control Cords must also be slack. Thus, please ensure that all cords are fairly long. Use of devices which can transfer manual power to machine directly is not permitted, for example use of clutch wires or brake wires is not permitted.</p>
<h3> Safety</h3>
<p>The machines you build will be first checked for size and safety. The machine should not cause electrical power breakdowns. The robots must not contain any combustible, corrosive, or otherwise dangerous materials. No explosive, compressive or expansive, either internal or external is permitted. There is a risk of compressed containers rupturing and creating shrapnel therefore they are not allowed. Any robot whose strategy or operation is considered dangerous can be disqualified by the judges at their discretion.</p>
<h3>Fouls/Penalties</h3>
<p><ol type="1">
<li>Team members are not permitted to touch either their machines (except for the case when the participant is engaging the machine or the cylinder). The penalty for doing so is disqualification on judges’ discretion. No addition or removal of any part(s) is allowed in any of the stages.</li>
<li>The robots are not allowed to leave part(s) on any part of the arena. In case some part of the machine falls on the arena, the penalty (including disqualification) will be based on judges’ discretion.</li>
<li>Machines damaging any part of the arena will be disqualified. Damaging does not include unintentional scratch(es) on the painted surface by the machine. Once again judges’ discretion will be used.</li>
<li>During the game run if a machine is static continuously for a minute than the machine is disqualified</li>
</ol></p>
<br>
<p>The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit. Change in any rule, if any will be highlighted on the website.</p>
