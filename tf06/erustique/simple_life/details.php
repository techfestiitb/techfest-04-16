<h3>Nellikuppam Village</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Nellikuppam is a small country town in the Cuddalore 
district of Tamil Nadu. The EID Parry and Company managed by the Murugappa Group are controlling the sugarcane and other allied produces in the area. n-Logue Communications has helped deploy corDECT WLL system in the Nellikuppam area to benefit the sugarcane farmers. Several kiosks have been located in the homes of several farmers, who are literate enough to understand and operate the system, after sufficient training. The kiosks will have a PC, power backup and in some instances a printer also. Between 30 and 50 farmers register with one of the kiosks depending on their location and get to know the prices of their produce including sugarcane at the click of the mouse. The farmers also find out about other information like the weather, other market position etc. The most impressive thing about this facility is that the information is provided in the local language, Tamil in this case. These centres also provide opportunities for the farmers to browse and educate themselves in various other fronts. This village was a first in terms of rural teledensity in rural India and a breakthrough in terms of rural Internet penetration.

<h3>Melur Village</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: In the year 2001, almost the entire village of Ulagapichanpatti in the Melur taluk of Tamil Nadu lost its okra crop to an unknown disease. The following year, the leaves of the plant again turned whitish-yellow, signaling the persistent disease's return. Only this time, the village had the assistance of a Chiraag Internet Center, set up by an enterprising 18-year old woman with the help of a loan. Like all Chiraag kiosks in the taluk, the Ulagapichanpatti center had an established relationship with the Madurai Agricultural College and Research Institute. When a farmer reported the problem, the operator sent an email to a scientist at the school, who requested a picture of the diseased plant. Using the kiosk's Web camera, the operator promptly responded and had a solution a day later. The plants were infected by “yellow mosaic disease,” a problem easily treated with a boron and nitrogen solution. Within a week, the treatment worked and the plants became healthy again. The entire village quickly learned about the solution, which saved more than US$3,300 worth of crops.</p>
