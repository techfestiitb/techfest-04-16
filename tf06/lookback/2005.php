     <h1 id="toptext">Lookback Techfest 2005</h1> 
	 <p>Techfest 2005, IIT Bombay's annual Technological festival, has the clear-cut
distinction of being the largest fest of its kind in the entirety of Asia. Having gone
international from 2004, it, now, strives to be reckoned among the best in the world.
The festival this year was scheduled from 28th-30th of January. The aim has been
clear - to initiate and further the spirit of the vibrant and dynamic student community.
The crux of the fest was simple - Technology for All, and this was achieved by hosting
events with far-reaching impact, ranging from robotic competitions, exhibitions of
major technological innovations, lectures by eminent personalities, workshops
providing hands-on-experience; to fun-filled contests involving creative concepts like
constructing bridges and buildings from drinking-straws!! Techfest 2005 ended
making many promises for next year.</p>

<h1 id="toptext">Survivor</h1>
<img src="./img/survivor.jpg" hspace=10 width=150 vspace=5 align="right">

<p>The big leap in 2004 with the introduction of
Cliffhanger, the international competition, helped
Techfest in making it’s mark among colleges and
industry the world over. In it’s second attempt at
taking a bold step, Techfest 2005 introduced Survivor,
which took off with nail-biting competition. Darwin’s
theory gained a whole new dimension as the phrase
“SURVIVAL of the fittest” now applied to strong,
rugged machines!!! With a total prize money
amounting to $2500 at stake, one by one the best
among all the machines entered the arena and performed their feat. The ruthless
competitive spirit among the participants was infectious, complemented with a tremendous
amount of cheering from the audience that filled the convocation hall of IIT Bombay.</p>

<h3>Yantriki</h3>
<p> The premier robotics competition across fests in India. Micromouse, where robots are
supposed to autonomously find their way out of a maze, remained individually, one of the most
visually spectacular events on offer!!! Another robotics event, Rescue, challenged participants to
make their robots go up an incline with blocks, build a bridge once there and come back. A great
display of innovation once again enthralled the crowds.</p>
<h3>Drishti</h3><p> One of the most important competitions aimed at a noble cause of improving aids to
assist the visually impaired, Drishti was conceived by Techfest 2005 in association with the
National Association for the Blind (NAB).</p>
<h3>Laststraw</h3><p><img src="./img/last.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=5 width=150 align="right"> Following the tradition of being cast with a difference, this time around Last Straw
forayed into exciting and unexplored avenues. The models of flyovers presented for Under
Construction were some of the most mind-boggling contraptions. Participants displayed amazing
bridge structures which they had managed to put up using just simple ice cream sticks.</p>
<h3>Chemsplash</h3><p> Explores all the aspects of chemical engineering, starting from the age old
hardcore distillation towers and piping networks to the synthesis of nano-magnets, all
compressed into a schedule of hands-on competitions, simulations, lectures lasting three days.
An event of Chemsplash, U Turn had the problem statement to make a chemically powered
machine go ten feet and turn back.</p>
<h3>Open Competitions</h3><p> These include Open Hardware, Open Software which have been a regular
feature over the years. This year Techfest also introduced Open Design. Anything that might
enhance the quality of life qualified as a genuine entry for this competition.
<p>Other competitions featured at Techfest 2005 included Udaan, Atlantis, Decathlon, Contraption,
Anaconda, and many more.</p>

Humanoid Robot soccer match, the robots developed and
conceptualized by Prof. Baltes and his team from University of
Manitoba, Canada. Apart from the match the robots also
demonstrated various other skills like robot dash, penalty
kicks, obstacle runs, and lift and carry. The audience was in
awe as they watched the diminutive little figures actually
dancing to music like the Macarena and other catchy
numbers.</p><br><br><br><p><img src="./img/oat.jpg" hspace=10 width=150 vspace=5 align="left">
The Open-air Theatre of IIT Bombay was host to a packed
