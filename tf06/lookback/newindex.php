     <h1 id="toptext">Techfest - over the years</h1> 
	<p>Techfest – IIT Bombay’s annual technological festival is stepping into its ninth year of existence. In a very short time since its inception in 1998, Techfest has become the most prominent event in the calendar of all science and technology enthusiasts in India. Techfest went international in 2004 and is presently the unrivalled largest fest of its kind in Asia. </p>
	<p>Techfest enjoys a large <strong>participation of students from about 750 colleges across India</strong> and has in the past hosted teams from countries like <strong>USA, Singapore, Iran, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal</strong>. The participants at Techfest are not just restricted to students. Techfest brings together eminent thinkers, scientists and professors from different fields as well as corporate heads through a variety of exhibitions, lectures and workshops. It is this wide variety of personalities that makes Techfest such a ‘complete’ festival – covering the entire spectrum from the development of technology to its practical applications and uses.</p>
	<p>Techfest is very proud to have been associated with industry leaders in the past like<strong> Reliance, Veritas, Daimler Chrysler, Intel, Microsoft, HCC, Mastek, Honeywell, HCC, Indian Oil, The Indian Express, The Week, Chip, Digit, Zee Business</strong>  and many more big names as sponsors and media partners.</p>
	<h1>Events</h1>
	 <p>The events at Techfest, over the past eight editions, can in general be classified under Technoholix, Lecture Series, Competitions, Hub & Exhibitions, and Workshops: </p>
	 <h3>Technoholix</h3>
	 <p><img src="./img/mclaren.gif" hspace=10  vspace=5 align="right">Technoholix is the most glamorous and glitzy event of Techfest. Held in the Open Air Theatre (OAT) of IIT Bombay, that can house a capacity of 7500 people, technoholix provides a variety of entertainment through the three nights of Techfest, letting everyone soak in the electric atmosphere and just relax after a hard day’s work in our numerous competitions and workshops. The spectators are enthralled by a number of events which include cutting edge technology along with some fantastic displays.</p>
	 <p>Last year, we had exhibited a McLaren Mercedes F1 racer, the MP4 -15, accompanied by a dazzling laser show - the first time that a Formula One Car was on public display in India! </p><br>
	 <p></p>
	 <p><img src="./img/humanoid.gif" hspace=10  vspace=5 align="left">Also, humanoid robot soccer matches were played to a gallery of packed spectators who were left awed seeing the robots perform a number of tasks such as playing soccer to even dancing to popular tunes. </p> 
<p>The final night at Technoholix saw the grand finale of the Sci Tech hosted by Barry O’Brien, who has been our quizmaster for the past two years. The finals were conducted with great finesse from the setting of the questions to the high level of technology used in giving the finalists computerized answering pads and LCD monitors</p><br><br>
<h3>Lecture Series</h3>
<p>Prominent members from varied fields have come to Techfest to share their ideas and works. The speakers are all great achievers in their respective fields and however different the lectures may be, one thing for sure is that every speaker has left behind a spell bound audience – one that is more informed than ever before about numerous aspects of the field.</p>

<p>Speakers in the past have included the Hon’ble President of India A P J Abdul Kalam, Prof Kevin ‘Cyborg’ Warwick, Dr K. Kasturirangan (ex-Chief, ISRO), Dr. Ponani Gopalkrishnan (Head, IBM Research Labs, India),   Dr Stephen Wolfram (Creator of ‘Mathematica’), Mr. Narayanmurthy, Sir Roger Penrose, Mr. Rajat Gupta, Mr. Richard Stallman, media guru Alyque Padamsee and Dr. Jayant Narlikar among others.</p>
<h1>Competitions</h1>
<p><img src="./img/survivor.gif" hspace=10 vspace=5 align="right">Competitions form the backbone of Techfest – the largest of all the events! In every edition, the competitions have become tougher but have been met with an even greater response from participants. At Techfest’s Competitions participants are pit against the best minds in the country, and with prizes of over 6 lacs to be won, stakes run high.</p><br>
<p>  A brief look at the competitions in the previous years :</p>
<h3>Survivor -The International Challenge </h3>
<p>The challenge was to build a wireless robot that climbs an inclined plane, survives a 1 metre fall, completes a prescribed task and then follows a line autonomously all in competition with another participant’s machine.  </p>
<h3>Micromouse</h3>
<p>Make your machine navigate through a standard maze, all by itself, as fast as possible! Techfest 2005 witnessed the completion of the maze in a whopping 17 seconds. Also teams from Iran placed 2nd and 4th in Micromouse 2005.</p>
<h3>Drishti</h3>
<p>A competition to develop aids for the blind. In association with the National Association for the Blind (NAB), this was a first step taken by Techfest 2005. We hope to continue in this direction and make giving back to society a tradition of Techfest.</p>
<h3>Chemsplash </h3>
<p>Chemicals and chemical engineering galore! Chemsplash at Techfest has always sought for out-of-the-box thinking related to Chemical Engineering, through competitions like <strong>Chem-e-Car</strong>, which involved making a completely chemically powered car which could traverse certain distance, based on certain constraints such as going a certain distance and completely coming to a halt, or completing a given distance in the shortest time possible . <strong>U-Turn </strong>at Techfest 2005 involved such cars to go a distance of 10 metres and come back to the starting point with the best possible accuracy.  In 2005, Chemsplash came up with the innovative and spontaneous <strong>“Dexter’s Den”</strong> which invited mathematical models from participants and demanded there implementation within two days, after 3 different on-the-spot problem statements were posed on the first morning of the fest.</p>
<h3>Last Straw</h3>
<p><img src="./img/laststraw.gif" hspace=10  vspace=5 align="left">Civil engineering beckons… hair-tearing problem statements that demand you to make complex structures using simple, commonly available materials like straws, popsicle sticks, thermocol and so on…</p>
<strong>Open Events</strong>
<i>Open Software, Open Hardware, Open Design</i>
<p>Events that have no constraints on what to create or design - the only criteria of judging are their usefulness and applicability – anything that makes life simpler! 
</p><br>
<p>Pre defined challenges like <strong>Contraption, Anaconda, Udaan, Decathlon, Atlantis.</strong></p>
<h1>Hub and Exhibitions</h1>
<p><img src="./img/hubgif.gif" hspace=10  vspace=5 align="right">The Hub – an extremely well suited toponym is the place buzzing with activity throughout Techfest. Informal on-the-spot competitions, which test spontaneity and creativity, are the big draws at The Hub. Teasing and interesting problem statements have been met with equally ingenious solutions. Prizes are also aplenty in the form of T-Shirts, caps and books. Apart from this, the Hub also has its own lectures, documentaries and logic quizzes. </p><br>
<p>Exhibitions at Techfest have always left the viewers exhilarated. On display are some of the latest innovations and breakthrough technology. Past exhibitions have included</p><br>
<strong>R&D Exhibition </strong>(’05 & ’03) – Showcasing the latest in cutting-edge technologies.<br><br>
<strong>Navy Exhibition </strong>in Techfest 2004 – the first exhibition of its size and kind held at a venue other than a naval dockyard by the Indian Navy.<br><br>
<strong>IAF Para-jumping exhibition (2004)</strong>held on Jan 26th to commemorate Republic Day& Air Force Exhibition (2002).<br>

<h1>Workshops</h1>
<p><img src="./img/workshop.gif" hspace=10  vspace=5 align="right">Workshops at Techfest have been hands-on experiences, where there is a great deal of interaction between the participants and the speaker. The emphasis in the workshops is to provide good exposure about the latest developments in the field of science and technology to the participants as well as to be able to apply the theories and basics learnt into a working model.</p>
<p>A number of topics like User Centric Designs, Animation, Security, Robotics, Forensics, Smart Materials and Cryptography have been covered under workshops in previous editions of Techfest.</p>
<p>Every Techfest has left behind poignant memories for the organizers as well as the participants. It has also served as an inspiration to make the next edition more memorable. The Techfest team believes in change as its mantra for raising the standards of the fest & change it is that will be most prominently seen in Techfest 2006. </p>
