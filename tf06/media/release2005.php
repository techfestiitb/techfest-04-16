	<h3>Press Release 3'rd November'04</h3>


<p>Techfest, the very name which is reckoned with an essence that transgresses not only physical boundaries but also humbles our intellectual nuances, gets into its eighth year this winter of 2005. The journey which began with a thumping note on the pleasant  morn of January '98 is going on all hale and hearty, and has been promising  greater exhilaration  with each year rolling in; the coming year certainly being an exception: oops.... don't worry ! the level of excitement and fun will only find a steep acclivity: that's going to leave you with an endless craving  for a bit  more.</p>

<p>From the humble motivation of making technology synonymous with fun (as the caption for the first Techfest went - Technology is Fun), we have indeed spanned a wide arena in all perceptible dimensions. For technology being the keystone of modern civilization, we do feel  "It Just Takes a Dream to Create the Future". And arguably the vast turnouts from the academia and corporate world just goes to prove that the proclamation is but warranted. This annual confluence of technology-buffs is, for obvious reasons, a unique opportunity for the industrial interface to share a common platform , and carry on with the winning accomplishments: for at the Techfest, everyone is unmistakably a winner.</p>

<p>The latest episode of Techfest kicks off on the 28th of JAN 2005, with a very sober , but significant aim, "Technology for All"; carrying on with the legacy of the bygone years of its existence, certainly with a perspective that finds an apt relevance in the present context.</p>

<p>Techfest has grown to have a reputation of doing new things every year, be it the first videoconference in India, holding a defense exhibition or showcasing Sony Aibo robots playing football. Techfest 2004, the seventh Techfest, as always, took the fest to new levels with the introduction of an international event. This bold step is unprecedented in India and IIT Bombay was proud to be the first to face up to the challenge.</p>

<p>Techfest, in its enduring efforts to bring the academe to a platform for a better interaction with the movers and shakers of the technological scenario, has always been graced by the presence of  eminent personalities:Dr.Abdul Kalam (Hon. President of India), Dr. R. Chidambram, Mr. Richard Stallman, Mr. Rajat Gupta, Mr. Narayanamurthy (Infosys), Prof. Mohanbir Sawhney (Kellogs, GSM), media guru Alyque Padamsee and Dr. Raghuram Rajan are few of the noted speakers at the techfest.</p>

<p>Techfest couldn't have boasted its unblemished success and popularity without the active involvement of its patrons, who have over the years come forward gleefully to make this event worth-remembering. Some of the truly admirable corporate houses have been our trusted patrons. Over the years, Techfest has had the privilege of being associated with industry leaders like Daimler Chrysler, Citibank, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Wipro, Philips, AMD, Veritas, Tata Power Broadband, Reliance Infocom, Webtek, Indian Oil, Pepsi, National Geographic Channel, Discovery et al as our sponsors with TATA Indicom as our title sponsors last year.</p>

<p>We are proud to be associated with Reliance Industries Ltd. as out Title Sponsors. A very impressive list of associate partners include Veritas, Microsoft, Intel, Indian Oil, HCC, Chip Magazine, Indian Express Group, Aramex and British Council.
</p>

<p>With each of the above bearing their individual drawing cards, the visitors no doubt land themselves up in a real decision-making arena. Sounds similar to a case-study in a  management entrance test !!?!! Well, thats Techfest  for you .
</p>

<p>The immensely wide gamut of events that form the backbone of this technological extravaganza can be precisely clubbed under the following heads: Events, Competitions and Workshops.</p>


<h1>Events</h1>

<p>With Events drawing the major chunk of the visitors, it can be assumed to be the voice of Techfest. This year  the events, comprise of the following  attractions:</p>

<h3>Communique</h3>

<b>	Lecture Series</b>

<p>The distinguished lecture series at Techfest promises the participants a rendezvous with the who's who and the greatest achievers of our times. Started with the aim of enabling participants to interact with their role models, the lecture series has always been one of the star attractions at Techfest.</p>

<p>This year , amongst the list of distinguished speakers is Dr. Kasturirangan, who doesn't really require a lengthy introduction: Dr. Kasturirangan who  steered the Indian Space programme gloriously for over 9 years as Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, of Space Commission and Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Space. He is  presently Honourable  Member of the Parliament.</p>

<p>Another well known name in India, Dr. P Gopalakrishnan, Director of the IBM India Research Laboratory(one of the company's eight labs) has been lined up for Techfest 2005. Dr. Gopalakrishnan comes with over 16 years of experience in technology and research, and now leads a team of researchers in developing innovative technologies for IBM products and addressing the unique issues faced by customers in the region. He also leads the worldwide research strategy for pervasive (ubiquitous) computing.</p>

<p>Stephen Wolfram, best known as the creator of Mathematica and the author of 'A New Kind of Science' would be speaking to the audience at Techfest from across the globe through video-conference. Having had a distinguished academic career beginning at an early age, Stephen Wolfram founded Wolfram Research in 1986, and has divided his time between leadership of his company and pursuit of basic science, over the last decade.</p>

<b>	Xgesis: The Technical Expostion</b>

<p>Techfest presents Xgesis the technical exposition. The event which gives one and all the opportunity to speak their heart out, that is if they are in love with science.</p>

<p>The true meaning of exposition was questioned while conceptualizing Xgesis. Is it a statement, an answer, an explanation? Maybe. But whatever it is, you need to know what you speak. Take up any topic of your choice, absolutely any topic... related to science and technology and then the rest is all very simple. Just tell us what you have to say on the topic and walk away with a grand prize. You may encounter a bit of competition from other aspirants, but then, what's a reward without a struggle, right?</p>
<h3>Technoholix</h3>
<p>After a grueling day spent competing at Techfest the last thing you would be look forward to at  night would be more technology, right? Wrong!!</p><p>Technoholix is Techfest at Dark. With some awe-inspiring displays that would sweep you off your feet, Technoholix would unmistakably keep your Techfest memories afresh</p>

<p>Previous Techfests have seen a spectrum of events - a brilliant display of 3D Laser that left the Open Air Theater of over five thousands hungry for more, Sand Animation by Ferencz Cako of Hungary, The German AIBO Team that showed awesome skills with Sony's soccer playing robots, Mercedes SL 500 Roadster's launch in India, Formula 3 car from the stables of TATA Racing India, live multiplayer gaming? The list goes is endless.</p>

<p>In this this year's Technoholix you will witness nothing less than a 3 vs 3 Humanoid Robot soccer match !! The first official event of its kind in the entire world. Apart from the match, the humanoids would also demonstrate the various skills including robot dash, obstacle run, penalty kicks and lift and carry.</p>

<p>Just as we'll have a clash of the Metal Men, Technoholix will also include the battle of the very best minds from all over India in arguably the toughest Science and Technology Quiz. SciTech - The growth of its name and glamour is second only to the growth in the competition that the contestants face.</p>

<h3>Yantriki</h3>
<p>Problem statements that offer young robotics enthusiasts and connoisseurs the platform to gain invaluable experience both with the technology and the practical elements that go into the making/automation of a robot and has featured intriguing workshops and lectures providing insight into the field of robotics. </p>

<p>The events featured in Yantriki @ Techfest 2005 will be :</p>

<b>Survivor</b>

<p>"SURVIVOR", the international challenge, is the name of the competition that alone promises to fetch you a booty exceeding 2500 USD. The problem statement expects you for construct a wireless remote controlled machine, capable of covering a slope and reaching a platform a meter high; wherefrom it jumps off to the ground. On completing this extraordinary feat, the machine would be manually controlled to complete a task involving moving some blocks into position, then go into autonomous mode to follow a wavy line to the end. If you think that is hard, you'll probably have a harder time swallowing the fact that you would be competing with the best in the world.</p>

<b>Micromouse </b>
<p>The world famous competition comes to India in its raw form, for a second time in Techfest. In this contest, the contestants design and build small self-contained robots to negotiate a maze in the shortest possible time autonomously. 
The objective of this contest is not only to promote intelligent robotics in India, but also to prepare the teams for the famous International Micromouse contest. Thus this platform would help the teams to test and run their robots in realistic micromouse contest constraints. </p>
<b>Rescue</b>
<p>With a team consisting of  maximum of four students, this is expected to pose a real challenge for all those who have been basking in the glory of having made some thing really great, at some point of their life.
To add to the beauty of the problem, the statement goes like this: There is a princess, and then there is our brave mechanical hero who would let no barrier stand in his.way to lead the queen safety. The team is challenged to take the princess to a castle atop a hill. But there is a moat in your way which you have to fill up and complete the path. 
So, to suit it into a problem of practical relevance, the groups are expected to come up with a machine that can carry blocks up a rugged incline, fill up a rectangular well with them and complete the path to cross over. Then carry an object and tread over the path constructed and place it in a specified location. 
<b>JUNIOR</b>
<p>For the first time, Techfest presents a challenge to our young scientists. As the name of the event suggests, this is meant for students upto higher secondary level (10+2). However, the problem statement may put even the undergrads in to a sort of dither.
The only thing this event asks for is to design a vehicle (mechanism) which can move a 500 ml Sprite (beverage) bottle into a zone situated at a distance, in the same plane. </p>
<b>Power Boats</b>

<p>Why does a machine have to run only on land? Well, it doesn't and Yantriki's Power Boats is a step towards proving just that. The aim of this competition is to build a wireless remote controlled 'power boat', which travels around a racing circuit on water in the shortest possible time. The basic requirements for the boats, to be kept in mind, are speed and agility.</p>

<h3>Chemsplash</h3>
<p>Chemspalsh  is the event that puts the mettle of a modern day alchemist to an ultimate test. With very fundamental concepts of Chemical Engineering, Chemsplash responds to the need of a wide arena of issues ,ranging from environmental safety to energy solutions.</p>
<p>The events under this head are:</p>


<b>Faculty Defined Problems</b>
<p>Chemsplash@Techfest2005 is proud to present the Faculty defined Programming and Simulation competition. The driving force behind this event is to expose the student community of India to the latest and foremost in modelling and coding and the hurdles they can expect on the job.
The faculty at Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay will present problem statements related to simulation, to give the participants a flavour of the kind of research taking place in the department.
The problems will be challenging and it can be expected that good amount of effort will be required for successful completion. The capability and endurance of participants will be stretched to their limits. Generous helpings of creativity and "out of the box" abilities will be a necessity. 
And of course, like everything else at Techfest 2005, there's lots of money to be won. In short, if you're remotely interested in Chemical Engineering, take a shot at it! </p>
<b>U-Turn</b>
<p>Ten feet and back. That's all that machines need to traverse to successfully complete U-Turn.
Sounds easy?  Ha! You jump to conclusions quickly, don't you? The car (or machine, put whatever you want) will have to be controlled on a self chosen fuel and a corresponding reaction both of which should not only be efficient, but also get over just in time! That means the car has to go ten feet, no further and then come back ten feet, no further! To add to an already tough problem, no mechanical systems (Brakes and the sort) are not allowed.
At Techfest, things are never what they seem, are they?
The creativity in design, the error in the distance and a poster which the participants make about the car will all have a say in the final result. This event is something you don't want to miss! </p>
<b>Viscometer</b>
<p>The notion of viscosity was first introduced by Newton as a constant relating shear rate and shear stress in the mid-17th Century Viscosity can be vaguely defined as the resistance to fluid motion. Viscosity is one of the fundamental properties of matter just as density, heat capacity etc. The value of viscosity of the fluid plays a major role in determining the flow pattern under given conditions.</p>
<p>Techfest 2005, invites all young Newtons to design and craft their own viscometer, one which would be able to measure the viscosities of 3 different fluids within the range of 1-600 cP. What could you gain by measuring viscosities of liquids, you ask? A lot of money!!</p>

<h3>Last Straw</h3>
<p>Last Straw began its journey in 2001 and what started as a simple straw based structure making competition has today grown to become the battle ground of civil engineers and has in its fold plethora of events. Targeted at unleashing the creative side of the budding civil engineers, these events have seen some very good efforts by the participants bringing out their ingenious ideas blended with technical foresight.</p>
<p>The event still carries on with its essence - "Simplicity  Redefined".
Following the tradition of being cast with a difference, this time around Last Straw is all set to foray into exciting and unexplored avenues.</p>

<b>Under Construction</b>
<p>One of the favourite events of Techfest has been the one involving construction of models of real-life structures using just straws. This time around, 'Under Construction' expects the participants to design a scaled down model (1:50) of a flyover connecting two platforms of height 10m (20cm) and 15m (30cm), going over a overhead tram network midway of the flyover span of height 15m (30cm), using only straws, satisfying the understated constraints and that can withstand a moving load passing the flyover.</p>
<b>Skyline</b>
<p>This would be one of the very few competitions at Techfest which would not require any moving parts. Skyline gives a chance to all aspiring architects and civil engineers to prove their mettle, with its goal being, to design and analyze a 13 floor building, theoretically situated in Mumbai city. The building must not only include basic amenities, such as water tanks, but also luxuries such as a swimming pool and a garden. The plans of this mammoth tower have to be submitted on paper or on AutoCAD.</p>
<h1>Competitions</h1>
With Events being the voice of Techfest , Competitions is certainly, the pulse of  the fest.Amidst the soiree that sets the technological front afire, competitions , without a hesitation forms one of the most popular inclusions in the TECHFEST. <p>Fostering the spirit of Techfest, the competitions enable students to construct, destruct, simplify, complicate, understand and battle it out in challenges designed specifically for the purpose of instilling the spirit of striving to achieve the best. 
Competitions at Techfest is the amazing, enthralling and inspiring ensemble of events where the best are pitted against each other resulting in something extra ordinary. Its the one place and event which shouldn't be missed to demonstrate your talent in front of the best possible audiences. So, when you come to competitions, the list is really exhaustive:</p>
<b>Drishti</b>
<p>If anyone really doubted the relevance and association of Techfest with something which is closer to the lives of the masses; than just flashing off  of ultra-modern gadgets; then this certainly will be an eye-opener for him.
On 14th of October 2004, on the occasion of the World Sight Day, Techfest 2005 launched DRISHTI. One out of every 80 Indians is a blind person. Have you ever given a thought to the fact that despite all the technological advancement we have made we still have a long way to go as far as elegant aids for the blind are concerned ?</p>
<p>Techfest, in association with The National Association for the Blind (NAB) has undertaken to call upon students to come up with practical, affordable and innovative solutions to aid the visually impaired. Techfest will collaborate with the NAB to ensure that the entries received are provided with the requisite support needed to develop into functional aids. We hereby intend to contribute its bit to the society, by encouraging the budding engineers and scientists to apply their brains for this noble cause. The motto is clear - making this world a better place to live in.</p>

<p>What is the competition ?<br>
The participants are expected to come up with workable solutions as aids for the blind. Simply an idea on paper is not what we look for. You are encouraged to present a solution which is practical and feasible.</p>

<h3>Udaan</h3>
<b>Chuck Gliders</b>
<p> The event being one that is open to students even upto the post-graduation level, it would be a worth watching event during the ensuing Techfest. With each one them trying it out on the arena - making a glider out of Balsa wood, which when projected from a launching platform glides in air for the longest duration of time. The launching platform also has to be made by the participant; and the  glider with the maximum time of flight  takes all the accolades.</p>
<b>Hot & Rising</b>
<p>Ever wanted to ride in a hot air balloon? How about building one from scratch? That too using candles. Confused? The Hot & Rising competition featured at Udaan would require the participants to design a mini hot-air balloon which would be run on ordinary candles. Still confused? Come and witness the glory at Techfest.</p>

<b>CRO 1.0</b>
<p>This event certainly calls for a competitive lot of grey cells. Making a grid completion game through an electronic circuit, the display of which has to be on a standard Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO). Apart from the execution of the logic of the game, you will also have to work on the basic appearance of the game. The game has to be playable by any user through an input device.</p>

<b>Contraption</b>
<p>The dictionary defines a contraption as a mechanical gadget. Very true, especially, in this event which would require the contestants to design a mechanical setup capable of making a glass of lemonade using common ingredients. The goal may sound simple, but that's exactly what the contraption must not be. Infact, the machine must make maximum usage of energy transformations and be as complex as can be imagined. With an enormous amount of prize money to be won, one thing is for sure about this event - a glass of lemonade would be just around every corner.</p>


<b>Decathalon</b>
<p>Some would define this as "The Event" of Techfest, and it may prove to be just that. Teamwork, patience, intelligence and hard-work are the essence of this competition which would requires groups of 5-6 people competing in a series of mind-numbing challenges over a span of 2 days during Techfest. The participants would be tested on various fields such as electronics, electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, communication and presentation skills; and the team which emerges the winner would certainly have something to look forward to - a huge chunk of money coming their way.</p>

<b>Game Tantra</b>
<p>The gaming culture in India is growing Leaps and Bounds now, and has given rise to a whole new industry here - the game development industry. Techfest, in association with Dhruva Interactive, gives you a chance to be on the inside of this whole new exciting field. For the first time ever, a competition where you design the game and others (read judges) play it. What's the fun in it, you ask? Well, winning sure is.</p>

<b>Open Hardware</b>
<p>Innovate to create. Transform your innovative ideas into reality and see your dreams realize. And Open Hardware is the ultimate platform to showcase your radical and unconventional hardware developments. It incites you to nourish your ideas. It is one of the premier and most challenging competitions at Techfest. You can bring for display any device, gadget or equipment that has been conceptualized, designed and developed by you. Emphasis is placed upon innovation, besides aspects like creativity, marketability, technical superiority and how well it addresses its cause.
Take a note while deciding to participate in Open Hardware, and do not confuse between Open Design and Open Hardware. All entries of hardware projects or products which are practical and at various stages of implementation come under Open Hardware.</p>

<b>Open Software</b>
<p>'Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning'.
Open Software invites all the software wizards to bring forth any software designed, developed and coded by them. Participants have the liberty to code in any language based on Windows / Unix / Linux. Software which has been used commercially is not acceptable for the competition. Judges will consider innovation, type of problem chosen, marketability and presentation of the software while judging. The participant will have all rights over his/her software. Source code shall not be made open to anyone except the judges, if the participant so desires. </p>

<b>Open Design</b>
<p>Open Design Contest endeavors to challenge your designing skills to come up with new products/ideas and stimulates your creative ability in coming up with improvements for existing products. Anything that might enhance the quality of life qualifies a genuine entry for this competition. So, let your ideas see the daylight and overawe others with your innovatory might.
But make sure that you have read Open Hardware too before deciding your entry and put your entry in the appropriate competition.</p>

<h1>Workshops</h1>
<p>The last, but not the least, of the integral elements of Techfest is of course the Workshops.</p>
<p>Workshops are an educational rendezvous emphasizing on the interaction and exchange of information among its participants and the speakers. The underlying theme behind workshops is "do while you learn". While no knowledge is worthless, the one which you learn by doing things yourself has no parallels. The workshops aim at showing you a path less traversed. They are designed to give impetus to the students with the familiarity, awareness, or understanding gained through experience or study. </p><p>The following workshops have been lined up for Techfest 2005 :</p>
<b>Animation Workshop</b>
<p>Animation is something which fascinates all of us. We still remember our childhood favorites Mowgli of The Jungle Book and the funny rabbit of Alice in Wonderland. Their world today is ruled by the Shreks and the Monsters. But is the world of animation so limited? The answer is, No.</p>
<p>This workshop aims at introducing you to the various aspects of Animation. These include 2D animation and Flash, and 3D character modeling and animation. Something to bring out that hidden artist in you.</p>
<b>Usercentric Design Workshop</b>
<p>The idea behind usercentric designs is that if the technology does not work for people, it doesn't work.
In the whirlwind of product development, compromises are often made that affect your customer's experience. Even if you are familiar with the features your customers want, how those features are put together is often as important as what they are.
The workshop will tell you about the basic ideas involved in designing a product keeping in mind customer's requirement. How is it that one artifact of technology has one shape rather than another? By what process do the unique and not so unique, designs of manufactured goods come to be? Can the development of knife and fork of the west be explained by the same principles that explain the chopsticks of the east?</p>

<b>Security Workshops</b>

<p>Today computers have pervaded all the facets of human life. They are used for a variety of purposes like storing important information, performing critical tasks, entertainment. The advent of Internet, mobile computing and e-commerce multi-folded their usage. With these there arise new problems like ensuring data protection, prevention of unauthorized access that need to be addressed. Every day we keep on hearing about the malicious attack by viruses, experience packets flooding the network, snooping of data, unauthorized accesses and so on. Due to the severity of the problem special security techniques are required for the smooth and effective working of computers.</p>
<p>Techfest In association with SecNet brings you a series of small workshops which will address key issues in computer and network security.</p>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secure Coding </b>
<p>This workshop will explore the origins and reasons for the poor software available in today's marketplace. The emphasis will principally be on the process and the way of thinking necessary for producing secure applications. </p>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firewalls</b>
<p>A firewall is a set of related programs, located at a network gateway server, that protects the resources of a private network from users from other network. The workshop aims to provide experience in analyzing one's operational requirements, and to create a security policy, which can be implemented and tested.</p>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital Certificates</b>
<p>The Workshop will teach you basics of generating and using digital certificates, for secure communication (SSL), as well as for signing your emails using PGP!</p>

<p>With these and more events being featured at Techfest 2005, it is expected to be a grueling 3-day event for the participants and a fun-filled technology bonanza for the audience.</p>
