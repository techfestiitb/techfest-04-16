<h1>Press Release 7th August 2005</h1>
<p>‘The only thing that is constant is change’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - Greek philosopher, Heraclites
</p>
 <p>Techfest - IIT Bombay's annual international science and technology fest enters its ninth year when it kicks off on the 20th of January, 2006. The 3-day, 3-nite festival aims to do a complete overhaul of Techfest and what it has been like over all these years.</p>

<p>The focus will be on specific fields of technology - departing radically from our previous approach of covering the various fields of engineering through themes like Yantriki (Robotics), Chemsplash (Chem Engg competitions), Last Straw (Civil Engg. competitions), Udaan (Aeronautical design) and so on. Make no mistake though that Techfest has reached its status of being "Asia's largest festival of its kind" solely because of the vision of its pioneers - and how!!! It has only been 8 years since its launch. So far, Techfest has had international participation from the USA, Singapore, Iran, Sri Lanka , Pakistan and Nepal.</p>

<p>Techfest 2005 had an audience of 30,000 over the period of 3 days. The McLaren Mercedes F1 car display was the first time ever that a Formula One car was unveiled, in public, in India. Add to that, competitions like "Survivor", the international challenge, with a total prize money of $2500 and "Micromouse", which witnessed the setting of the new Indian record for Micromouse, by completing the maze at 17 seconds. The world record stands at 9 seconds - not too far away we think!! </p>

<p>Techfest has always featured some of the best speakers, eminent and respected in their fields. Last year was no exception with Dr. K. Kasturirangan - former Head, ISRO - and Mr. Stephen Wolfram (creator of Mathematica), Dr. Ponnani Gopalakrishnan (Head, IBM Research Labs, India) being some of the big names. Of-course, the list of people associated with Techfest over the years includes towering personalities like Hon’ble President of India A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Dr. Kevin "Cyborg" Warwick, Dr. R. Chidambram, Mr. Rajat Gupta (McKinsey and Co.), Mr. Narayanamurthy (Infosys), Dr. Raghuram Rajan (IMF), Mr. Richard Stallman, Sir Roger Penrose (long time co- researcher with Dr. Stephen Hawking), ad-guru Alyque Padamsee, Dr. Jayant Narlikar among other greats. </p>
<p>Yet, to keep pace with the rapidly evolving world of science and technology we must do our bit to bring home this very change. Techfest 2006 is an attempt at providing a link between the grand and puzzling innovations occurring today and the modest and powerfully utilitarian yet completely obscure and unknown inventions. </p> 
<p>Our themes for this year are : artificial intelligence (A.I.), automobile and aviation technology (SIXTH GEAR), smart technologies and mobile computing systems (SMART TECH), space exploration technology (COSMOS), construction technology (CONCREaTE) and as a modest step towards enhancing life in rural India, e- RUSTIQUE, our theme on emerging rural technologies in India.</p>

<h3>e-Rustique</h3>	 
<p>Emphasizing on the humane side of technology, it startles us with the progress it has achieved on the national scene. The President's PURA (Providing Urban amenities to Rural Areas) mission has given the impetus which has resulted in the inclusion of the theme in this year's setup. Focusing on areas as diverse as communications, information technology, networks, infrastructure and more, it strives to make an honest effort in dealing with pertinent issues of paramount importance - all towards the cause of making the lives of Rural India simpler, easier and better. </p>
<h3>A.I.</h3>	 
<p>A.I. at Techfest aims to give you a glimpse of the infinite possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence and sheer power of machines of the future. Competitions will involve making of machines that learn with experience, and programming others to obey human orders. Through exhibitions, lectures and workshops to supplement these we aim to give you a glimpse at some of the things at the heart of A.I.  – THE field as far as the future is concerned! </p> 
<h3>Sixth Gear</h3>
<p>The greatest invention of man is said to be the wheel - which of-course came a long, long time ago. Put it together with the power of the "fire", not surprisingly one of man's most important discoveries and you get the biggest and most powerful brutes on the road and in the air today....They are also primarily the reason why we can get around so easily today…. and in the future too!! </p>
 <p>However it’s all that goes between the fire and the wheel that sets the great cars apart from the good cars. And that is where you come in! Sixth Gear aims to give you an insight into the marvel and power of auto-tech and aviation technology.... </p>
<h3>Cosmos</h3>
<p>COSMOS is our theme on space exploration technology. Our population is exploding at an uncontrollable rate...soon if we don't find more "space" we will find it difficult to live with ourselves…literally! At the same time man's inherent curiosity to go star-gazing has today led to him landing his little machines even on Mars! Build such machines that will perform similar tasks in simulated space-like environments.</p>
<p>The search for "life" and the quest for knowledge go on at COSMOS in Techfest 2006.</p>
<h3>CONCREaTE</h3>
<p>It has always been a wonder how our architects and engineers have managed to conjure up such brilliant ideas and then actually build such magnificent structures… right from 3200 B.C., when the pyramids were built in Egypt to relatively modern marvels like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Eiffel Tower, bridges like the Golden Gate Bridge to underwater tunnels and just beautiful structures like the Sydney Opera House and the Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>CONCREaTE is the chance for tomorrow's geniuses to prove their skills at building sound, strong and elegant structures out of commonplace materials like thermocol and straws.</p>
<h3>Smart Tech</h3>
<p>Convenience incarnate! Taking life and turning it into leisure. We show you how our lives have changed as gadgets and gizmos have infiltrated through. A simple approach to technology which has made us stretch back and relax. Imagine having a single remote controlling every possible electronic device in your home, or mobiles which double up as security devices. The future beckons – we’ve heard the call…</p>
