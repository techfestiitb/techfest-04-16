<h1>Press Release 27th Nov. '05</h1>
<p>Techfest enters its ninth edition, Techfest ‘06, and will be held from 20th – 22nd January, 2006. The current edition makes a departure from the standard type of technical fest where emphasis of the various events is usually on specific engineering branches. Instead the focus lies on specific fields of technology, or ‘themes’, and their diverse applications.</p>
<p>The themes at Techfest ‘06 are artificial intelligence (<strong>AI</strong>), space exploration technology (<strong>Cosmos</strong>), aviation and auto-tech (<strong>Sixth Gear</strong>), smart technologies (<strong>Smart Tech</strong>), modern structural engineering (<strong>CONCREaTE</strong>) and lastly emerging rural technologies (<strong>eRustique</strong>). Competitions, lectures, exhibitions and workshops will be a part of each theme to try and cover it exhaustively.</p>
<p>Spread over 3 days and 3 nights the fest attracts a massive participation of about 30000 students from over 750 colleges and involvement from about 1500 corporate and faculty from all over the world. Techfest has thus emerged as an ideal platform for fruitful interaction between the students, academia and faculty. Every edition of Techfest has always left behind some very vivid memories be it the enterprising competitions or the hallowed speakers.</p>
<p>Some of the most prominent events over the years include competitions like Micromouse, Survivor, Cliffhanger, Last Straw, Chemsplash, Contraption and Drishti. Techfest has also been graced by prominent speakers like Hon’ble President Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, the CEO of McKinsey Mr Rajat Gupta, Prof Kevin ‘Cyborg’ Warwick, Dr. Kasturirangan of ISRO and Mr. Narayan Murthy of Infosys. An exhibition has always been a big draw at Techfest and not without reason for Techfest presents some very colorful exhibitions like the IAF and Navy exhibitions and R & D exhibition. The spotlight at Techfest ‘05 was on the McLaren Mercedes of David Coulthard, the first time a Formula 1 car had been observed at such close quarters in India to the general public and that too in a college fest!</p>
<p>This year too, Techfest ‘06 brings a series of events to keep everyone mesmerized for those 3 days. With so many wonderful events on the cards, it becomes a very difficult task to choose the best. So after much comparison between the events, here’s a sneak peek at the highlights of Techfest ‘06</p>
<h1>Exhibitions</h1>
<h3>Arizona State University’s Mars Rover Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Arizona State University (ASU) has been collaborating with NASA on the <strong>Mars Rover Project</strong> and has developed an exhibition that details the various aspects of the mission. When it comes to IIT Bombay in January, India will have the distinction of being only the second place outside USA where the exhibition has been hosted. In May 2005, it was also a part of the China Science and Technology Week hosted by the Govt. of China and over the week, the exhibition attracted over a million viewers!!! Needless to say it was a big hit, and it is expected that it will also be the most talked about event at Techfest ‘06. </p>
<p>The exhibition will consist of scaled down models of the spacecrafts, probes & rovers used by NASA on Mars as well as some of the specialized equipment designed for the mission. There will be videos with panoramic views of Martian terrain, fly through views over the canyons of Mars, footage of parts of the mission from terrestrial take-off to Martian landing as well as beaming of the latest images fresh from their cameras on Mars! Apart from this there will be a team of 5 of their senior researchers to guide us through the exhibition who will also take part in interactive Q & A sessions with the audience. </p>
<h1>Competitions</h1>
<p>This year Techfest presents 4 problem statements - in A.I, e – Rustique, Cosmos and Sixth Gear, each of which carries prize money of USD 1000 and travel reimbursements for each of the winning teams! Read on for more….</p>
<br>
<h3><u>A.I (Artificial Intelligence)</u></h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence lets machines think and act independently, based on their interactions with the environment. Right from the simplest aspects of human life, like solving riddles, to the most complex of things like identifying handwriting, A.I makes it all possible… A.I. - the field of the future without a doubt!</p>
<h3>1) Micromouse-Masters of the Maze</h3>
<p>This is the first of the 4 ‘USD 1000’ problem statements. A standard competition at many prestigious fests/ technical meets around the world, Micromouse involves designing an autonomous device that can solve a given maze in the shortest amount of time. Last year, at Techfest ‘05 the maze was solved in a mere 17 seconds! Will the record be bettered this year??</p>
<h3>2) Character Recognition</h3>
<p>In the world of A.I, the first step towards solving any task is to identify the stimulus present. Quite often the stimulus is in the form of written matter and therefore character recognition becomes an issue of paramount importance. Participants must code a program which can identify mouse drawn / stylus written on screen characters. The competition will be held in two stages – firstly, the code will be tested and then the teams must give a presentation about their code</p>
<h3>3) Crux</h3>
<p>This one is for the all-knowledgeable ‘technoholic’. Crux is the technical paper presentation competition. Participants are allowed to pick any topic of their choice related to Artificial Intelligence like neural networks, natural language processing etc and write a technical paper on it. Short listed entries will then have to come to IIT Bombay during Techfest to make a presentation on the same.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>e–Rustique (Emerging Rural Technologies</u></h3>
<p>The majority of our country’s population lives in the villages where technology is yet to permeate into everyday lives. With the aid of technology, rural India can surely work wonders in the development of the country. Our Hon’ble President APJ Abdul Kalam’s mission of Providing Urban amenities to Rural Areas (PURA) is a step in this direction. At Techfest we believe the student community can play a major role in this noble endeavor and keeping this in mind we have the theme of e–Rustique which looks at how technology can be used to tackle grass root issues like infrastructure, education, communication, health, commerce and other aspects that can further the interests of the rural community. </p>
<h3>1) The Simple Life v1.1</h3>
<p>The second of the ‘big’ competitions, The Simple Life v1.1 takes a look at the rural conditions and how it can be improvised after considering the various demographic factors. Participants must conceive an application software, which is modeled upon a chosen rural scenario, and developed by analyzing data which the organizers will provide (Competition Data Section on the website) about the particular village. Simply put, participants have to create software that can be used in a village kiosk. </p>

<h3>2) AgroBot</h3>
<p>How does one tackle growing deforestation? The answer is AgroBot! Devise a wired remote controlled machine that can dig holes in the mud and plant maximum saplings in minimum amount of time. The machines must be able to carry 15 pre loaded saplings and then plant ten of these in the ten pits on the arena in the given time of 10 minutes. Not to forget, agility matters because there will be two machines competing simultaneously on the arena!</p>
<h3>3) Innovision</h3>
<p>Have an idea for tackling some of the problems faced by rural India? Put it down on paper and present it at Techfest ’06! Innovision takes a look at how innovation and improvisation of technology can be used to solve some of the problems faced by the rural community. Participants can choose from the problems listed on the website (link is given below) or come up with something equally relevant. The write up must cover the feasibility, the value addition as well as the cost effectiveness of the idea. Qualifying entries will need to come up with a working solution / prototype / model / poster presentation which explains the concept with clarity.</p>

<br>
<h3><u>Cosmos (Space Exploration Technologies)</u></h3>
<p>Space has always been a fascinating interest for mankind since ages. What lies beyond terra firma is a question that has posed itself innumerable times and every time man has made an attempt to unravel these mysteries of space he has always managed to land up with more mysteries. Man has relentlessly pursued his dreams from sending satellites into space to man on the moon and rovers on Mars! Cosmos is a look at this endless quest of man…</p>
<h3>1) G.R.I.P</h3>
<p>The International Space Station (ISS) has been one of man’s greatest dreams for space and now is well on its way to completion. G.R.I.P is set in the backdrop of the ISS in circa 2009, with the ISS days away from finish when catastrophe strikes. The all crucial energy providing fuel cell of the ISS has been knocked out by a meteorite collision. The only way it can be secured is with the help of the Galactic Instrumental Recovery Probe (G.R.I.P) which moves on a network of rails. So it is all up to the teams now to play savior. The teams must build a wired/wireless remote controlled machine, which can traverse a grid 1.250 m high, collect a cylindrical object (fuel cell) located at a specific point below the grid and then place the cylinder in the hollow cylindrical container provided. The competition will be on a knock out basis and the team finishing the task in the least time will progress to the next round.</p>
<p>G.R.I.P is the third of our competitions which offer USD 1000 as prize money with travel reimbursement to the winners.</p>
<h3>2) Black Box</h3>
<p>High up in space, what is the best source of energy? Undoubtedly it would have to be solar energy which is the most abundant and hence most viable. So the big question then is how this energy can be harnessed. The answer is a solar sail - a large, flat surface that harnesses the energy of photons (light) from the sun to propel a spacecraft around the solar system. In Black Box, teams must devise a model of a solar sail that can initially fit into a box of given dimensions and when subjected to an electrical/mechanical impulse expand so as to have the maximum projected area in the given direction. Black Box is a true test of efficiency, of making the maximum out of limited resources.</p>
<h3><u>Sixth Gear (Automobile and Aviation Technologies) </u></h3>
<p>Welcome to the world of supersonic jets and charismatic concept cars. Starting from the small wheel man has made giant strides in the fields of transportation from land to water to air. The focus has shifted beyond just transportation and now the areas keenly followed are aerodynamic packages, speed, elegance and eco friendliness of late. Sixth Gear follows this trend in the field and showcases some of the very best marvels in the sector.</p>
<h3>1) Full Throttle</h3>
<p>Full throttle, as the name suggests, is a competition in which a remote controlled car must cover a given stretch of 40m in the fastest time possible. What’s so different about this event? Firstly, the prize money at stake is USD 1000(along with travel reimbursement to the winning team), the last of the big 4 competitions!  Secondly this event lets participants use I.C engines of up to 3.2 cc so that they can achieve the maximum speed possible to make it a flat run across the straight. Teams must also build start and stop mechanisms for their own machine. </p>
<p>It’s Get, Set and Go!!!!! The time’s begun…</p>
<h3>2) Hover Junior</h3>
<p>For all the bright young minds out there, Hover Junior is the chance to display the talents that budding engineers and scientists possess. For school students up to 10 + 2 only, Hover involves designing a hover craft that travels along a given terrain and performs pre defined tasks along the way. Played on a knockout basis, the machine that accomplishes the tasks fastest will be declared the winner.</p>
<br>
<h3><u>Smart Tech (Smart Technologies)</u></h3>
<p>Take a look around and one sees that technology is everywhere. It has permeated into our lives, handling simple day to day tasks to even complex industrial tasks. This, however, is just the beginning…the future promises much more in terms of smart technologies. All we have to do is lay back and enjoy the proceedings; everything else will be taken care of!</p>
<h3>1) Prayaas</h3>
<p>Technology can be incorporated to benefit everyone and one section of society where it is extremely useful is in the case of physically disabled people. Techfest ‘05 showed how this is possible through Drishti, a competition which involved designing and improving on aids to help the visually impaired lead a more comfortable life. The response was tremendous and truly overwhelming. Taking off from last time, Techfest ‘06 in association with the <strong>National Association for the Blind (NAB)</strong> and the <strong>Happy Hours Centre (HHC)</strong> presents Prayaas. Prayaas is all about an effort to use technology and devise solutions to make the lives of the disabled simpler and more comfortable. Participants can pick a problem from the given list (on website - link given below) or come up with their own problem statement. The solutions must be adaptable, cost effective and practical. </p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://www.techfest.org/smart_tech/prayaas/index.php" target="_blank">www.techfest.org/smart_tech/prayaas/index.php</a> for detailed problem statements</p>
<h3>2) iClean</h3>
<p>Cleaning up after everything is done has always been a major problem ? Build an autonomous machine that can collect a specific amount of material- puffed rice (murmure) - and dump it into a specified zone of the arena. The machine that cleans up the arena fastest is the winner!</p>
<h3>3) Home Alive</h3>
<p>An ideal home would be one in which all our needs are taken care of – from the necessities of doing daily chores to our recreation and entertainment to even security features. In the fast growing world of technology, smart homes are the next big thing. In Home Alive, participants must design one such smart home on a given layout taking into consideration the systems mentioned (present on the website). The qualifying round for this competition consists of a write up on Smart Security Solutions and the teams that make it through to the finals will then have to make a presentation that take into account the entire house and more than a single ‘smart’ system.</p>
<p>For the layout and ideas please visit <a href="http://www.techfest.org/smart_tech/home_alive/index.php" target="_blank">www.techfest.org/smart_tech/home_alive/index.php</a></p>
<br>
<h3><u>CONCREaTE (Modern Structural Engineering)</u></h3>
<p>Architecture marvels from the Pyramids of Giza to the CN Towers have never ceased to amaze us. Some of the structures have lived for ages and ages but are still going strong. So what makes good structures? What role has technology played in building superior structures? The theme CONCREaTE offers you the chance to explore and answer some of these questions for yourself!</p>
<h3>1) H</h3>
<p>What are structures normally made of? Brick and cement would be the answer. Here’s the chance to do something different. Build a Helipad using Popsicle sticks (ice-cream sticks) and threads satisfying certain constraints. The lightest structure that can support the maximum weight is the structure with the most efficient design and will be declared the winner.</p>
<h3>2) Bridged</h3>
<p>Taking a professional approach, Bridged invites tenders for the construction of a bridge (plan on website). A plane truss bridge of deck 60 x 250 cm that can withstand a load capacity of 800 N/m with a safety factor of 1.5 is the required design. The tender must include a detailed hand drawn drawing showing the various sections of the bridge and must specify material costs, labour costs, time for construction as well as the maximum deflection that it can bear. Selected teams will be called for a PowerPoint presentation of their design and short listed teams will then get a chance to build the bridge on site. May the best team get the contract! </p>
