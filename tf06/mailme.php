		$mes .= "\r\n\r\nTechfest is back  this time in a bigger, better and a brand new version! Change has always been a part of Techfest and this edition will prove to be no different. Techfest 06 takes a giant step by stepping away from its previously established events and competitions to come up with a format central to which are hot and happening themes. These themes have been chosen on specific fields of technology and their applications rather than just basing them on branches of engineering knowledge.";
		$mes .= "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. I.";
		$mes .= "\r\n\r\nA.I  the name says it all. Artificial Intelligence. The buzzword for the future. We present to you the opportunity to create and code these machines of tomorrow that will obey orders, learn through experience and try to come as close to the human level of thinking as possible. Through a series of lectures, workshops and competitions, we shall give you a glimpse of things to come, things that are at the heart of Artificial Intelligence!";

The micromouse must be entirely self-contained, autonomous and should not receive any external assistance. The maze will have walls between which the machine must traverse the maze. Multiple paths to the destination square are allowed and are to be expected.";

The future holds more potential than we can ever imagine - be it in terms of materials or design. Through all of this, what must still count is the strength of the structure. At CONCREaTE, we give you a platform to display your skills in building a strong and sound structure with commonplace materials.";

In May 2005, ASU was invited to the China Science & Technology Week to display the technologies in use. ASU has been working on this with NASA, and in the whole festival (organized by the Govt. Of China), theirs was the only non-Chinese organization invited to display its technologies. Though needless to mention, it WAS a big hit and over a million people attended the ASU exhibition!";
		
		$mes .= "\r\n\r\nA similar exhibition will be held on each day at Techfest (scheduled from Jan 20-22), and of-course, India is only the second country outside the US where the exhibition is being held!!! ASU will be sending a team of 4-5 NASA researchers to guide us through the exhibition. Some highlights of what can be expected: ";
		
		$mes .= "\r\n\r\ni)  Display of scaled-down models of the space-craft, the rovers and probes on Mars, and full-sized models of the instruments fitted onto the probes and space-craft to perform the special functions required during such a mission. Also on display will be fist-sized meteorites collected by ASU over the years.";
		
		$mes .= "\r\n\r\nii) Latest videos, fresh from the rovers on Mars, to be beamed down at the exhibition!!!";

This is a thought that has been echoed even by the Honble President of India A.P.J Kalam, a past speaker at Techfest, in his PURA (Providing Urban amenities to Rural Areas) mission for India. eRustique is an attempt by Techfest to take a step in the right direction by concentrating on some of the core issues faced by the villages like communications, infrastructure, health and education and show with the help of technology, how these problems be reckoned with.";

The first stage is the calling for ideas, wherein a shortlist will be made, and the second will be the actual development period with assistance provided by industry. ";
		
		$mes .= "\r\n\r\nThe idea is to develop software that can be used in the village kiosk (after analyzing the situation  inherent advantages, handicaps, abilities, weaknesses, etc. - of the village and the villagers) and take appropriate action. Certain data like the population, occupations, physical conditions etc will be provided, based on which the analysis has to be made.";

Students of different institutes can come together to form a team. Your hovercraft will have to descend along a 5-degree incline, cross a pit and then cross a water-body and finally three loosely fixed flags must be knocked down before turning back and coming to starting point. All this will be in competition with a rival hovercraft and must be done of-course with an air-cushion at all times between the craft and the surface below.";
